<p class="ph2">THE STORY OF SANTA<br>
KLAUS</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br>

<small>WHO IS SANTA KLAUS?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you go to England you will find many people
there who have never heard of Santa Klaus. Only
the other day a leading London paper confessed that
it could not understand why a magazine for children
should be called St. Nicholas.</p>

<p>Now if you were asked the question which heads
this chapter do you think you could answer it so as
to make an Englishman understand who Santa Klaus
is? Could you also explain what connection Saint
Nicholas has with children?</p>

<p>Of course you might glibly reply:</p>

<p>“Santa Klaus is the Dutch diminutive (or pet
name) for Saint Nicholas, and Saint Nicholas is the
patron saint of boys and girls.”</p>

<p>But the Englishman might want to know more
than this. Perhaps you yourself would be glad to
know more. It is for the purpose of supplying you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
with information that I have prepared this little book.</p>

<p>Let us begin with the legends which concern this
holy man and see what help they will give us. I say
let us begin with the legends, because history itself
tells us little or nothing about the saint beyond the
fact that he was Bishop of a town called Myra in
Asia Minor and that he died about the year 342.
Legend fills out these meagre details with many a
pretty story which throws a kindly light upon the
character of good Saint Nicholas.</p>

<p>You know what a legend is? It means a story
which was not put into writing by historians at the
time when the thing is said to have happened, but
which has been handed down from father to son for
hundreds and sometimes for thousands of years. It
may or may not have had some basis of truth at the
beginning. But after passing from mouth to mouth
in this fashion it is very likely to lose what truth it
once possessed. Still, even if the facts are not given
in just the manner in which they happened there is
nearly always some useful moral wrapped up in the
fiction that has grown around the facts. That is
why wise and learned men are glad to collect these
legends from the lips of the peasants and other simple
minded folk who have learned them at their
mothers’ knee, and who believe that they are all true.
These legends are called by the general name of
folk-lore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>Two brothers of the name of Grimm once collected
into a book the folk-lore of their native country, Germany.
This book is known to you as Grimm’s Fairy
Tales. Hans Christian Andersen also found among
the legends of Denmark some of the prettiest and
most fanciful of his tales.</p>

<p>Now stories concerning Saint Nicholas abound in
almost every country of Europe, for almost every
country except Great Britain is interested in his name
and fame. He may, indeed, be called the busiest of
all the saints. In the first place legend makes him the
patron saint of children all over the world, no matter
of what sex or color or station in life. Ever childlike
and humble, so we are told by a quaint old author, “he
keepeth the name of a child, for he chose to keep the
virtues of meekness and simpleness. Thus he lived all
his life in virtues with this child’s name, and therefore
children do him worship before all other saints.”</p>

<p>One might think that to be a patron of the world’s
children would keep one saint pretty busy, even if it
did not exhaust his energies. Not so with Saint Nicholas.
He occupies his spare moments as the protector
of the weak against the strong, of the poor against the
rich, of the servant and the slave against the master.
Because he once calmed a storm he is the patron of
travellers and sailors and of many seaport towns. Because
he once converted a gang of robbers and made
them restore their booty to the men they had robbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
he is still thought to retain a kindly interest in thieves.</p>

<p>Moreover he is the patron of the largest of all European
countries, the empire of Russia.</p>

<p>Now we will make our promised examination of the
legends which have gathered around this saint and
given him a fame so widespread.</p>

<p>Saint Nicholas is said to have been born in a town
called Potara in Asia Minor. To the great wonder
of his nurses he stood up in a tub on the day of his
birth with his hands clasped together and his eyes
raised to heaven and gave thanks to God for having
brought him into the world. It is added that on Wednesday
and Fridays, (both fast days in the early
Church) he would refuse to take milk until the going
down of the sun.</p>

<p>His parents died when he was very young. As
they were wealthy they left him well provided with
the world’s goods. But he would not accept them for
himself. Instead he used them for the good of the
poor and of the Church.</p>

<p>When he was old enough he studied for the priesthood
in the town of Myra and was ordained as soon
as he had reached man’s estate. He at once set sail
on a voyage to the Holy Land to visit the tomb of
Jesus Christ in Jerusalem. On the way a dreadful
storm arose. The winds howled and whistled, the
great waves shook the vessel from stem to stern.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19-20]</span>
<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_019">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>The captain and the sailors who had been used to
bad weather pretty much all their lives declared that
this was the worst storm they had ever known. Indeed
they had given up all hope when the young
Nicholas bade them be of good cheer.</p>

<p>His prayers soon calmed the wind and the waves,
so that the ship reached Alexandria safe and sound.
There the saint landed and made the greater part of
the journey from Alexandria to Jerusalem on foot.</p>

<p>Returning by sea, he wished to go straight back
to Myra. The captain, however, would not obey his
orders and tried to make the port of Alexandria.
Then Saint Nicholas prayed again and another great
storm arose. And the captain was so frightened by
this evidence of the saint’s powers that he gladly listened
to his request and headed the ship towards
Myra.</p>

<p>In the year 325 Nicholas, then still a young man,
was elected Bishop of Myra. On the day of his consecration
to that office a woman brought into the
church a child which had fallen into the fire and been
badly burned. Nicholas made the sign of the cross
over the child and straightway restored it to health.
That is the first of his miracles which showed the
interest that he took in children.</p>

<p>Two other miracles which are still more famous
are thought to foreshadow the fame he has won since
his death as the patron of children and the bearer of
gifts to them at the holy Christmas season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>Among the members of his flock (so runs the first
story) there was a certain nobleman who had three
young daughters. From being rich he became
poor,—so poor that he could not afford to support
his daughters nor supply the dowry which would enable
him to marry them off. For in those days, as
even now in many countries in Europe, young men
expected that a bride should bring with her a sum of
money from her parents with which the young couple
could start housekeeping. This is called the dowry.</p>

<p>Over and over the thought came into the nobleman’s
mind to tell his daughters that they must go
away from home and seek their own living as servants
or in even meaner ways. Shame and sorrow alone
held him dumb. Meanwhile the maidens wept continually,
not knowing what to do, and having no bread
to eat. So their father grew more and more desperate.</p>

<p>At last the matter came to the ears of Saint Nicholas.
That kindly soul thought it a shame that such
things should happen in a Christian country. So
one night when the maidens were asleep and their
father sat alone, watching and weeping, Saint Nicholas
took a handful of gold and tying it up in a
handkerchief, or as some say placing it in a purse,
set out for the nobleman’s house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>He considered how he might best bestow the money
without making himself known. While he stood hesitating
the moon came up from behind a cloud, and
showed him an open window. He threw the purse
containing the gold in through the window and it fell
at the feet of the father.</p>

<p>Greatly rejoiced was the old gentleman when the
money plumped down beside him. Picking up the
purse he gave thanks to God and presented it to his
eldest daughter as her dowry. Thus she was enabled
to marry the young man whom she loved.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards Saint Nicholas collected together
another purse of money and threw it into the
nobleman’s house just as he had done before. Thus
a dowry was provided for the second daughter.</p>

<p>And now the curiosity of the nobleman was excited.
He greatly desired to know who it was that had come
so generously to his aid. So he determined to watch.
When the good saint came for a third time and made
ready to throw in the third purse, he was discovered,
for the nobleman seized him by the skirt of his robe
and flung himself at his feet, crying:</p>

<p>“Oh, Nicholas, servant of God, why seek to hide
thyself?”</p>

<p>And he kissed the holy man’s feet and hands. But
Saint Nicholas made him promise that he would tell
no one what had occurred.</p>

<p>The second legend is much more wonderful. It
tells how Saint Nicholas was once travelling through
his diocese at a time when the people had been driven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
to the verge of starvation. One night he put up at
an inn kept by a very cruel and very wicked man,
though nobody in the neighborhood yet suspected
his guilt.</p>

<p>This monster, finding that the famine had made
beef and mutton extremely scarce and greatly raised
their price, had conceived the idea of filling his pantry
with the fat juicy corpses of children whom he kidnapped,
killed and served up to his guests in all
varieties of nicely cooked dishes and under all sorts
of fancy names.</p>

<p>Nobody could guess how he alone of all the innkeepers
in that neighborhood could maintain a table
so well supplied with meats, boiled and roasted, and
stews and hashes and nice tasty soups.</p>

<p>But no sooner had a dish of this human flesh been
served up to the saint than he discovered the horrible
truth.</p>

<p>Leaping to his feet he poured out his anger in
bitter but righteous words. Vainly the landlord
fawned and cringed and protested that he was innocent.
Saint Nicholas simply walked over to the tub
where the bodies of the children had been salted down.
All he had to do was to make the sign of the cross
over the tub, and lo! three little boys, who had been
missing for days, arose alive and well, and, coming
out of the tub, knelt at the feet of the saint.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>All the other guests of the inn were struck dumb
at the miracle. The children were restored to their
mother, who was a widow. As to the landlord, he
was taken out and stoned to death, as he richly deserved
to be.</p>

<p>Another of St. Nicholas’ miracles shows that he
had a kind heart for grown-ups as well as for the
young folk. A revolt having broken out in Phrygia,
Emperor Constantine sent a number of his tribunes
to quell it. When they had reached Myra, the bishop
invited them to his table so that they would not quarter
themselves on poorer citizens, who might be ill
able to afford their keep.</p>

<p>A grand banquet was served up to them. As host
and guests were preparing to sit down, news was
brought into the hall that the prefect of the city had
condemned three men to death, on a false accusation
that they were rebels. They had just been led to
execution and the whole city was in a ferment of excitement
over this terrible act of injustice.</p>

<p>Nicholas rose at once from the table. Followed
by his guests he ran to the place of execution. There
he found the three men kneeling on the ground, their
eyes bound with bandages, and the executioner standing
over them waving his bared sword in the air.
Nicholas snatched the sword out of his hand. Then
he ordered the men to be unbound. No one dared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to disobey him. Even the prefect fell upon his knees
and humbly craved forgiveness, which was granted
with some reluctance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the tribunes, looking on at the scene,
were filled with wonder and admiration. They, too,
cast themselves at the feet of the holy man and besought
his blessing. Then, having feasted their fill
on the banquet that had been provided for them,
the tribunes continued their journey to Phrygia.</p>

<p>They, too, it was decreed were to fall under the
ban of a false accusation. During their absence
from Constantinople, Constantine’s mind had been
poisoned against them by their enemies. Immediately
on their return he cast them into prison. They
were tried and condemned to death as traitors. From
the dungeon into which they had been cast to await the
carrying out of this sentence they sent out a piteous
prayer to St. Nicholas for assistance. Though he
was hundreds of miles away, he heard them.</p>

<p>And that same night he appeared to Constantine
in a dream, commanding him to release these men
and to declare them innocent,—threatening him at the
same time with the wrath of God if he refused. Constantine
did not refuse. He took the saint’s word
for their innocence, pardoned them, and set them free.
Next morning he despatched them to Myra to thank
Saint Nicholas in person for their happy deliverance.
As a thank offering they bore him a copy of the
gospels, written in letters of gold, and bound in a
cover embossed with pearls and precious stones.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>Nor did the saint’s miracles end with his life. Even
after death he listened from his high place in heaven
to the prayers of the humblest and gladly hastened
to their assistance when they asked for help in the
right spirit and at the right time.</p>

<p>Here are three legends which have been especially
popular in literature and art.</p>

<p>A Jew of Calabria, hearing of the wonderful
miracles which had been performed by Saint Nicholas,
stole his image out of the parish church and bore it
away to his home. There he placed it in his parlor.
And when, next day, he had made ready to go out
for the morning he commended all his treasures to
the care of the saint, impudently threatening that his
image would be soundly thrashed if he failed in his
trust. No sooner was the Jew’s back turned, however,
than robbers broke into the house and carried off
all its treasures. Great was the Jew’s wrath when he
returned. Bitter were the reproaches he hurled at
the saint. Many and fierce were the whacks he bestowed
upon the image.</p>

<p>That very night Saint Nicholas, all bruised and
bleeding, appeared to the robbers, and commanded
them immediately to restore what they had taken.
Terrified at the vision they leaped to their feet, collected
the plunder, and brought it back to the Jew’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
house. The Jew was so astonished at the miracle that
he was easily converted to Christianity and baptized.</p>

<p>There was a wealthy man who, though married,
had no son to inherit his estate. This man vowed that
if Saint Nicholas would provide him with an heir
he would present a cup of gold to the saint’s altar
at Myra. Saint Nicholas heard the prayer and,
through his intercession, God sent the childless man
a son. At once the father ordered the cup of gold
to be prepared. When it was finished, however, it
seemed so beautiful in his eyes that he decided to
keep it for himself and offer the saint a meaner one
made of silver. When this, too, was finished, the merchant
with his son set out to make the presentation.
On the journey he stopped by a river to quench his
thirst. Taking out the golden cup he bade the son
fetch him some water. In obeying the child fell into
the river and was drowned.</p>

<p>Weeping bitter tears of repentance the merchant
appeared in the church of Saint Nicholas and there
made his offering of the silver cup. But the cup
would not stay where it was put. Once, twice, thrice,
it fell off the altar.</p>

<p>While all the people stared with astonishment, behold
the drowned boy appeared before them,—standing
on the steps of the altar with the golden cup in
his hand. Full of joy and gratitude, the father offered
both the cups to the saint and bore his son home
with thanksgivings to God and to His saint.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>A certain rich merchant, himself a Christian, dwelt
on the borders of a heathen country. He cultivated
a special devotion to Saint Nicholas. One day his
only son was taken captive by some of the wicked
neighbors across the boundary line and sold into
slavery. The lad finally became the property of the
pagan king, and served him as his cup-bearer.</p>

<p>One day, while filling the royal cup at dinner he
suddenly remembered that it was December 6, and
the feast of Saint Nicholas. He burst into tears at
the thought that his family were even then gathered
around the dinner table in honor of their patron.</p>

<p>“Why weepest thou?” testily asked the king.
“Seest thou not that thy tears fall into my cup and
spoil my wine?”</p>

<p>And the boy answered through his sobs:</p>

<p>“This is the day when my parents and my kindred
are met together in great joy to honor our good Saint
Nicholas; and I, alas! am far away from them.”</p>

<p>Then the pagan blasphemer swore a good round
oath and said:</p>

<p>“Great as is thy Saint Nicholas, he cannot save thee
from my hand!”</p>

<p>Hardly were the words out of his mouth when a
whirlwind shook the palace. A flash of lightning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
was followed by a loud peal of thunder and lo! Saint
Nicholas himself stood in the midst of the affrighted
feasters. He caught the youth up by the hair of his
head so suddenly that he had no time to drop the royal
cup, and whirled him through the air at a prodigious
speed until, a few moments later, he landed him in
his home. The family were gathered in the dining
room when saint and boy made their appearance,—the
father being even then engaged in distributing the
banquet to the poor, beseeching in return that they
would offer up their prayers in behalf of his captive
son.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>STRANGE ADVENTURES OF THE SAINT’S BODY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span>, as I have said, died in the year 342
and was buried with great honor in the cathedral
at Myra.</p>

<p>Being the patron saint of such roving folk as sailors,
merchants and travellers it was only natural that
his body should have lain in perpetual peril from
thievish hands. The relics of saints were highly
prized because it was held that they performed miracles
on behalf of the townsfolk and of the strangers
who visited their shrines. Of course the relics of so
great and popular a saint as Nicholas were especially
coveted, and most so by the classes of whom he was
the patron.</p>

<p>In those rude days it was believed that no saint was
greatly troubled by the manner in which his body was
procured. Even if it were stolen and reburied elsewhere
by the robbers themselves the body worked
miracles in its new abode as cheerfully as it had done
in the old one. Moreover it drew trade and custom
to any city in which it was enshrined and so brought
wealth to the people of the entire neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>In fact pilgrims from various parts of the world
came in crowds to the shrine at Myra. As the fame
of Saint Nicholas increased so did the value of his
relics. At various times during the first six centuries
after his burial attempts were made to carry off his
body by force or by fraud.</p>

<p>None of these attempts was successful until, in the
year 1084, certain merchants from the city of Bari,
in southeastern Italy, landed at Myra to find that the
entire countryside had been laid waste by an invasion
of the Turks. All the men who could bear arms had
gathered together and were now gone in pursuit of
the invaders. Three monks only had been left behind
to stand guard over the shrine of Saint Nicholas.</p>

<p>It was an easy task for the merchants of Bari to
overpower these monks, break open the coffin which
contained the body and bear it away with them to their
own city.</p>

<p>Here it was received with great joy. A fine new
church was built on the site of an old one which had
been dedicated to Saint Stephen and which was now
torn down to make room for its successor. This was
to serve as a shrine for the stolen body. The new
church is still standing and though it is now old it
is still magnificent. In a crypt or vault under its
high altar lies all that was mortal of the one-time
Bishop of Myra. On the very day of the re-burial,
so it is said, no less than thirty people who attended
the ceremony were cured of their various ailments.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41-42]</span>

<p class="caption">Heads of the Christ-child.<br>

<small>Selected from Raphael’s pictures.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>Such is the story that is generally accepted. But
another story was and is told by the people of Venice.
They, too, claim that they possess the body of Saint
Nicholas, and insist that it was taken from Myra by
Venetian merchants in the year 1100, and reburied in
Venice by the citizens.</p>

<p>They do not accept the story told by the Bari merchants,
but declare that the latter carried off from
another spot the body of another saint, possibly of
the same name, which they palmed off upon their
fellow citizens as the body of the former Bishop of
Myra.</p>

<p>The true body, they claim, is that which lies to-day,
as it has lain for centuries, in the church of St. Nicholas
on the Lido. The Lido is a bank of sand which
projects, promontory fashion, out of the Grand Canal
in Venice into the Adriatic Sea.</p>

<p>The fame of a holy man so closely connected with
two great trading ports of the Middle Ages was sure
to spread wider and wider among the nations of
Europe. And, indeed, we find that everywhere sailors
acknowledged him as their special guide and protector
and sang his praises wherever they landed.</p>

<p>Both at Bari and at Venice the churches dedicated
in his honor stand close to the mouth of the harbor.
Venetian crews on their way out to sea would land
at the Lido and proceed to the church of St. Nicholas,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
there to ask for a blessing on their voyage. There
also they would stop on their home-coming to give
thanks for a safe return. Sailors of Bari would in
the same way honor the shrine in which lay what
they claimed was the true body of Saint Nicholas.</p>

<p>Many tales of miraculous escapes from shipwreck,
due to the intercession of their patron, were related
by seamen and travellers, not only at home, but at
the various ports where they stopped, so that the name
and fame of the good Saint Nicholas grew more
resplendent every year. Churches erected in his
honor abound in the fishing villages and harbors of
Europe.</p>

<p>In England alone, before the Reformation, there
were 376 churches which bore his name. The largest
parish church in the entire land is that of St. Nicholas
at Yarmouth, which was built in the twelfth century
and retains that name to the present day. Some of
the other churches were rebaptized by the Protestants.</p>

<p>The churches dedicated to Saint Nicholas in Catholic
countries are especially dear to people who make
their living out of the sea. Sailors and fishermen
when ashore frequent them, and if they have just
escaped from any of the perils of the deep they show
gratitude to their patron by hanging up on the church
walls what are known as votive pictures. These are
either prints of the saint or sketches, rudely drawn by
local artists, which represent the danger that the sailors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
had run and the manner in which they had escaped.
Often a figure of Saint Nicholas appears in the darkened
heavens to calm the fears of the imperilled
mariners.</p>

<p>It is fishermen and sailors also who take the chief
part in the great festival in honor of Saint Nicholas
that is celebrated at Bari on the fifth and sixth of
December in every year.</p>

<p>Bari, it may be well to explain, is a very old and
still a very important seaport on the eastern coast of
southern Italy. It is situated on a small peninsula
projecting into the Adriatic. From very early days
the city has been the official seat of an archbishop and
hence possesses a grand old cathedral.</p>

<p>Grand, however, as is this cathedral, it is eclipsed
both in beauty and in popular regard by the church
of Saint Nicholas which I have already mentioned
as containing the bones of the saint. These repose
in a sepulchre, or huge tomb, that stands in a magnificent
crypt some twenty feet beneath the high altar.
Water trickles out through the native rock which
forms the tomb. It is collected by the priests on
a sponge attached to a reed, is squeezed into bottles,
and sold or given away under the name of “Manna
of Saint Nicholas” as a cure for many ailments.</p>

<p>On the eve of Saint Nicholas’ Day, that is on the
day before it (December 5th) the city of Bari is
overrun by hosts of pilgrims from the neighboring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
cities, as well as others from the furthest corners of
Italy and even from Mediterranean France and
Spain and Adriatic Austria. All Catholic mariners
whose ships happen to be lying in port at the time
are sure to join the throng.</p>

<p>The pilgrims carry staffs decorated with olive, palm
or pine branches. From each staff depends a water
bottle, which is to be filled with the manna of Saint
Nicholas. Most of the pilgrims are barefoot. All
are clad in the picturesque costumes in use in their
native places on holiday occasions.</p>

<p>On entering the church the pilgrims may, if they
choose, make a complete circuit of it, moving around
on their knees with their foreheads pressed every now
and then against the marble pavement. Often a little
child leads them by means of a string or handkerchief,
one end being held in the mouth of the pilgrim.</p>

<p>Next day, December 6th,—the actual feast of Saint
Nicholas,—is celebrated by a procession of the seafaring
men of Bari. Rising at daybreak they enter the
church early in the morning. The priests, who have
assembled to greet them, take down from the altar a
wooden image of Saint Nicholas, clad in the robes
of a bishop. This is handed over to the care of the
paraders for the rest of the day. The priests may
accompany the image only as far as the outer gate of
the church. The procession, with the image in the
hands of its leaders, files out into the street and, followed
by the populace, visits the cathedral and other
sacred or public places. Then the leaders take Saint
Nicholas out to sea in a boat. Hundreds of other
boats accommodate their fellow paraders, as also such
of the citizens as can afford the luxury, and follow
Saint Nicholas over the waves.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>The shore meanwhile is lined with the bulk of the
populace of Bari and the pilgrim visitors who eagerly
await the return of the image at night-fall. Bonfires
are then burned, rockets are shot off, everybody who
possesses a candle or torch lights it and the people fall
in line with the paraders to restore the sacred image to
its guardians at the church.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>CHRIST-KINKLE AND CHRIST-KINDLEIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> now told you all that is known of the story
of Saint Nicholas during his lifetime and even after
his death. I think you will agree that we have not
yet gone very far in identifying Santa Klaus, the
modern Saint Nicholas, with the historic saint who
was once Bishop of Myra.</p>

<p>It is true that some learned men have thought to
find in the legend of the three maidens an answer
to a couple of problems that bother the inquiring
mind.</p>

<p>First they explain that the three purses of gold,
which, in pictures by the old Italian masters, figure
as three golden balls, and which were looked upon as
the special symbol or sign of the charitable Saint Nicholas,
are the origin of those three gilt balls which
swing over a pawnbroker’s shop in token of that well-spring
of human kindness which has earned for him
the affectionate title of “uncle.”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51-52]</span>

<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">“Suffer little children to come unto me.”<br>

<small>Painting by B. Plockhorst.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>If you have a fine sense of humor you will see that
the last sentence is sarcasm. And if you have small
love for clever explanations that don’t explain, you
will reject this theory of the origin of the pawnbroker’s
sign and prefer to believe that it sprang
from the gilt pills which adorned the shield of the
great Medici family of Italy. Medici means doctors.
Both the name and the shield were reminders
that the family earned their first fame as physicians
many years before they became the greatest princes
and money changers of Europe.</p>

<p>But the other theory, what of that? The other
theory is more to the point. It assumes that the
Saint Nicholas who was Bishop of Myra is the Santa
Klaus of modern Christmas, whom he pre-figured
in the fact that he appeared in the night-time and
secretly made valuable presents to the children of a
certain household.</p>

<p>Here is some appearance of truth. In the first
place there can be no doubt that Santa Klaus and
Saint Nicholas are the same name. Indeed to this
day our Christmas saint is known either as Santa
Klaus or Saint Nicholas, Klaus in Dutch being “short
and sweet” for Nicholaus, and, as such, the same as
our Nick for Nicholas.</p>

<p>But, after all, there seems to be little likeness in
other respects between the saint of the legend and the
modern patron of the Christmas season. What connection
is there between a single case of charity, performed
at no particular time, with the splendid and
widespread generosity of Santa Klaus, who every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Christmas eve loads himself down with presents for
the little ones he loves, and finds means to distribute
them all over the land in a single night?</p>

<p>As the answer is not apparent on the surface, let
us turn to the other legend. We shall have to confess
however that the story of the three schoolboys
miraculously restored to life after they had been cut
up and salted down, helps us even less than does the
story of the three purses. It is simply one of a whole
group of stories wherein Saint Nicholas appears as
the friend and benefactor of children. In this respect
only does he resemble our Santa Klaus.</p>

<p>In all the characteristics which modern painters
and story tellers, in America, in Holland and in Germany,
have bestowed upon the jolly saint of the
Christmas season he differs entirely from the slender
and even emaciated Nicholas, clad in the robes of a
bishop, with a mitre on his head and a crozier in his
hand, whom the early painters were fond of depicting.</p>

<p>So the legends of Saint Nicholas afford but a slight
clew to the origin of Santa Klaus,—alike, indeed, in
name but so unlike in all other respects.</p>

<p>Let us turn elsewhere. In Germany and to a certain
extent in America the name Christ-Kinkle or
Kriss-Kingle is looked upon as another name for
Santa Klaus. But in fact history teaches us that
is a far different Being, though the two have been
welded into one in the popular imagination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55-56]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span></p>
<p>A very small knowledge of German reveals the fact
that Christ-Kinkle is simply a “corruption” or mistaken
pronunciation of the German word Christ-Kindlein
which in English means Christ-child. Now
the connection of the Christ-child with the gift-giving
season is obvious enough. In the first place He is
the hero of Christmas day itself. Born a human
child He ever preserved a great love for young
people.</p>

<p>“Suffer little children to come unto me,” He said,
“for of such is the kingdom of Heaven.”</p>

<p>The old masters were fond of painting Him as a
child among children. In nearly all the famous pictures
which Raphael, the greatest of Italian artists,
painted of the Holy Family or of the Madonna and
Child, the infant Jesus is accompanied by the infant
Saint John as friend and playmate.</p>

<small>THE EVOLUTION OF CHRISTMAS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> I must own that at first sight it is difficult
to explain how the Christ-child of the past—the Holy
One whose birth is remembered and honored in that
feast which we call Christmas, should gradually have
been changed into the white-haired, white-bearded,
merry-hearted and kindly old pagan whom we sometimes
call Christ-Kinkle but more frequently Santa
Klaus.</p>

<p>Yet at the very moment when we come face to face
with this difficult problem we have reached the explanation
which seemed impossible when we strove to
understand the much less startling transformation of
Saint Nicholas, Bishop of Myra, into Santa Klaus,
patron of the Christmas season.</p>

<p>We remember that the Christmas festival of to-day
is a gradual evolution from times that long antedated
the Christian period. We remember that though it
celebrates the mightiest event in the history of
Christendom, it was overlaid upon heathen festivals,
and many of its observances are only adaptations of
pagan to Christian ceremonial.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>This was no mere accident. It was a necessary
measure at a time when the new religion was forcing
itself upon a deeply superstitious people. In order
to reconcile fresh converts to the new faith, and to
make the breaking of old ties as painless as possible,
these relics of paganism were retained under modified
forms, in the same way that antique columns, transferred
from pagan temples, became parts of the new
churches built by Christians in honor of their God
and his saints.</p>

<p>Thus we find that when Pope Gregory sent Saint
Augustine as a missionary to convert Anglo-Saxon
England he directed that so far as possible the saint
should accommodate the new and strange Christian
rites to the heathen ones with which the natives had
been familiar from their birth. For example, he advised
Saint Augustine to allow his converts on certain
festivals to eat and kill a great number of oxen to
the glory of God the Father, as formerly they had
done this in honor of the devil. All pagan gods, it
should be explained, were looked upon as devils by
the early Christians.</p>

<p>On the very Christmas after his arrival in England
Saint Augustine baptized many thousands of converts
and permitted their usual December celebration
under the new name and with the new meaning. He
forbade only the mingling together of Christians and
pagans in the dances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>From these early pagan-Christian ceremonies are
derived many of the English holiday customs that
have survived to our day.</p>

<p>Now get clearly into your head one very important
fact. Although at the time when Augustine visited
England the date of Christmas had been fixed upon
as December 25 there is no biblical reason why this
should be so. The gospels say nothing about the
season of the year when Christ was born. On the
other hand they do tell us that shepherds were then
guarding their flocks in the open air. Hence many
of the early fathers of the Church considered it most
likely that the Nativity took place either in the late
summer or the early fall. The point was of no great
moment to them, as the early Church made more fuss
over the death day of a great or holy person than
over his birthday. The birthday is only the day when
man is born into mortality, the death day chronicles
his birth into immortality.</p>

<p>The important fact then which I have asked you
to get clearly into your head is that the fixing of the
date as December 25th was a compromise with paganism.</p>

<p>For countless centuries before the Christian era
pagan Europe, through all its various tribes and peoples,
had been accustomed to celebrate its chief festival
at the time of the winter solstice, the turning
point when winter, having reached its apogee, has
also reached the point when it must begin to decline
again towards spring.</p>

<p class="caption">Saturn, the God of Time.<br>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>The last sentence requires further explanation. I
shall try to put it into words as simple as possible.</p>

<p>You must be aware of the fact that the shortest
day in the year is December 21st. Therefore that
is the day when winter reaches its height.</p>

<p>It was on or about December 21st that the ancient
Greeks celebrated what are known to us as
the Bacchanalia or festivities in honor of Bacchus,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the god of wine. In these festivities the people gave
themselves up to songs, dances and other revels which
frequently passed the limits of decency and order.</p>

<p>In ancient Rome the Saturnalia, or festivals in
honor of Saturn, the god of time, began on December
17th and continued for seven days. These also
often ended in riot and disorder. Hence the words
Bacchanalia and Saturnalia acquired an evil reputation
in later times.</p>

<p>We are most interested in the festivals of the ancient
Teutonic (or German) tribes because they are
most closely linked with Christmas as we ourselves
celebrate it.</p>

<p>The pagan feast of the Twelve Nights was religiously
kept by them from December 25th to January<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
6th, the latter day being known, as it is still known
to their descendants, as Twelfth Night. The Teutonic
mind personified the active forces of nature,—that
is to say it pictured them as living beings.</p>

<p>The conflicts between these forces were represented
as battles between gods and giants.</p>

<p>Winter, for example, was the Ice-giant,—cruel,
boisterous, unruly, the destroyer of life, the enemy
alike of gods and men. Riding on his steed, the all-stiffening
North Wind, he built up for himself great
castles of ice. Darkness and death followed in his
wake.</p>

<p>But the Sun-god and the South Wind, symbols
of light and life, gave battle to the Ice-giant. At
last Thor, the god of the Thunderstorm, riding on
the wings of the air, hurled his thunderbolt at the
winter castle, and demolished it. Then Freija, the
goddess of fruits and flowers, resumed her former
sway. All of which is only a poetical way of saying
that after the Ice-giant had conquered in winter he
was in his turn overthrown by the Sun-god in spring.</p>

<p>Now the twenty-first day of December, the depth
of winter, marked the period when the Ice-giant was
in the full flush of his triumph and also marked the
beginning of his overthrow. It was the turning
point in the conflict of natural forces. The Sun-god
having reached the goal of the winter solstice, now
wheeled around his fiery steeds and became the sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
herald of the coming victory of light and life over
darkness and death of spring over winter.</p>

<p>A thousand indications point to the fact that
Christmas has incorporated into itself all these festivals,
Greek, Roman and German, and given them
a new meaning. The wild revels of the Bacchanalia,
the Saturnalia and the Twelve Nights survive in a
milder form in the merriment and jollity which mark
the season of Christmas to-day.</p>

<p>Christmas gifts themselves remind us of the presents
that were exchanged in Rome during the Saturnalia.
In Rome, it might be added, the presents usually
took the form of wax tapers and dolls,—the latter
being in their turn a survival of the human sacrifices
once offered to Saturn.</p>

<p>It is a queer thought that in our Christmas presents
we are preserving under another form one of the
most savage customs of our barbarian ancestors!</p>

<p>The shouts of “Bona Saturnalia!” which the Roman
people exchanged among themselves are the precursors
of our “Merry Christmas!” The decorations
and illuminations of our Christian churches recall the
temples of Saturn, radiant with burning tapers and
resplendent with garlands. The masks and mummeries
which still survive here and there, even in the
America of to-day, and which were especially prominent
in the Middle Ages, were prominent also in the
Saturnalian revels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>And a large number of the legends, superstitions
and ceremonials which have crystallized around the
Christian festival in Europe and America are more
or less distorted reminiscences of the legends, superstitions
and ceremonials of the Twelve Nights of
ancient Germany.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>SILENUS, SATURN, THOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now you may be tempted to ask, “What bearing
has all this stuff about the pagan festivals upon
the question of the identity of our old friend Santa
Klaus?”</p>

<p>I am coming to that. In every one of these festivals
the leading figure was an old man, with a lot
of white beard and white hair rimming his face.</p>

<p>In the Bacchanalia the representative god was not
the young Bacchus, but the aged, cheery and decidedly
disreputable Silenus, the chief of the Satyrs and
the god of drunkards.</p>

<p>In the Saturnalia it was Saturn, a dignified and
venerable old gentleman—the god of Time.</p>

<p>In the Germanic feasts it was Thor, a person of
patriarchal aspect, and a warrior to boot.</p>

<p>Now, although the central figure of the Christian
festival was the child-god—the Christ-Kindlein—none
the less the influence of long pagan antecedents
was too strong within the breast of the newly Christianized
world to be readily dismissed. The tradition
of hoary age as the true representative of the holiday<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
period, a tradition, it will be seen, in which all pagan
nations agreed, still remained smouldering under the
ashes of the past. It burst into flame again when
the past was too far back to be looked upon with dislike
or disquietude by the Church. No longer did
there seem to be any danger of a relapse into the
religious errors of that past.</p>

<p>At first the more dignified representative was
chosen as more in keeping with a solemn season.
Saturn was preferred to Silenus, and was almost unconsciously
rebaptized as Saint Nicholas, the latter
being the greatest saint whose festival was celebrated
in December and the one who in other respects was
most nearly in accord with the dim traditions of Saturn
as the hero of the Saturnalia.</p>

<p>If you look at the pictures printed in this book you
will see that in face and figure the Saint Nicholas of
the early painters was not unlike the ancient idea of
Saturn.</p>

<p>And it was many, many years before Saint Nicholas
had ousted the Christ-child from the first place
in the Christmas festivities. Indeed, as we shall see,
he often accompanied his Master on His Christmas
rounds. It may be added that he still does so in
certain country places in Europe where the modern
spirit has been least felt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe37_5" id="i_070fp">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_070fp.jpg" alt="Silenus and Fauns"><br>
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Silenus and Fauns.<br>

<small>Painting by Annibale Caracci.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In course of time, as the idea of worldly merriment
at the Christmas season prevailed over that of
prayer and thanksgiving, the name Saint Nicholas
gradually merged into the affectionate diminutive of
Santa Klaus. Under the new name the old saint lost
all his austerity. He became ruddier, jollier, more
rubicund in aspect, while the Christ-Kindlein faded
more and more into the background, until at last the
very name of the latter, under the slightly different
form of Kris-Kinkle, was transferred to his successor.</p>

<p>And now compare the pictures of Santa Klaus
which are scattered through this book with that of
Silenus. Is it not evident that the one is a revival
of the other, changed, indeed, in certain traits of character,
sobered up, washed and purified, clad in warm
garments that are more suited to the wintry season
which he has made his own, but still the god of good
fellows,—the representative of good health, good humor
and good cheer?</p>

<p>Extremes meet once more. The most modern hero
of the season of merriment is a return to the most
ancient. The Santa Klaus of to-day is the Silenus
of an unknown antiquity.</p>

<p>Let us learn a little more about Silenus. He was
the tutor of Bacchus and seems to have had so much
respect for his pupil that his life after the invention
of wine was one long spree. It was a merry and
good-natured spree, however. Silenus never became
maudlin or quarrelsome in his cups. He was the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
jovial of tipplers. His outlook upon life was as rosy
as his nose. A cheery laugh beamed over his large
fat face, the light of humor twinkled in his beady
eyes, his rotund stomach spoke of good cheer, his smile
beamed assurance of an unruffled disposition.</p>

<p>Among all the brute creation he chose an ass, that
caricature of the horse, as his favorite charger. He
always appeared with a troupe of laughing fauns and
satyrs around him, and his advent was everywhere the
signal for quips and cranks and wreathèd smiles.</p>

<p>Now Saint Nicholas, also, in former times used to
ride abroad on an ass, and still continues to do so in
certain portions of Europe. In fact, as already
noted, all the genial traits of Silenus, save only that
of drunkenness, are reproduced in Santa Klaus,—the
jolly pagan who is to-day the personification of
Christmas.</p>

<p>But though a modernized pagan god holds this
important position in our festival, everything that
could be offensive in the old pagan way of celebrating
it has been abolished.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>It was not always so. The Church which so wisely
sought to retain the old heathen forms, found it often
very hard, and sometimes impossible, to subdue the
heathen spirit. In spite of the protests of priests and
the anathemas of popes, in spite of the condemnation
of all wise and good men, Christians in the early days
frequently reproduced all the worst follies and vices
of the Bacchanalia and the Saturnalia. Even the
clergy were for a period whirled into the vortex. A
special celebration, called the Feast of Fools, was
instituted in their behalf with a view, said the doctors
of the Church, that “the folly which is natural to and
born with us might exhale at least once a year.” The
intention was excellent. But in practice the liberty
so accorded speedily degenerated into license.</p>

<p>Early in the history of the Church excesses were
so great that a council of bishops held at Auxerre
was moved to inquire into the matter. Gerson, the
most noted theologian of the day, made an immense
sensation by declaring that “if all the devils in hell
had put their heads together to devise a feast that
should utterly scandalize Christianity, they could not
have improved upon this one.”</p>

<p>If even among the clergy heathen traditions survived
so strenuously, what wonder that they survived
among the laity? The wild revels, indeed, of the
Christmas period in olden times almost stagger belief.
No amount of drunkenness, no blasphemy, no obscenity
was frowned upon. License was carried to
the utmost limits of licentiousness. Even in the
seventeenth century, when the revels had been slightly
toned down, Master William Prynne discovered in
them those vestiges of paganism which are apparent
enough to the historian of to-day.</p>

<p>“If we compare,” he says in his <i>Histrio-Mastix</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
“our Bacchanalian Christmas and New Year’s tides
with these Saturnalia and feasts of Janus, we shall
find such near affinity between them, both in regard
of time,—they being both in the end of December
and the first of January—and in their manner of solemnizing—both
being spent in revelling, epicurism,
wantonness, idleness, dancing, drinking, stage-plays,
masques and carnal pomp and jollity—that we must
conclude the one to be but the ape, or issue, of the
other.”</p>

<p>The very excesses of the Christmas period proved
their own eventual cure. In England the Puritans
revolted so bitterly that they for a period put an end
to Christmas altogether. In Europe the revolution
was more gradual. But everywhere a change of manners
and of morals has purified the festival over which
Santa Klaus presides, and Santa Klaus himself, even
if we look upon him as a revival of the pagan Silenus,
is a Silenus freed from all the offensive features of
paganism, a Silenus who with his new baptismal name
has taken on a new character.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>It must be remembered, however, that Santa Klaus
does not rule all over the Christian world. There is
even a wide difference between our Santa Klaus and
the Saint Nicholas of Southern France and Germany.
The latter, grave, sedate, severe, preserves more of
the Saturn than the Silenus type. He is Saturn
christianized and dignified with episcopal robes. He
distributes gifts like our Santa Klaus, but in addition
to gifts for good little boys and girls, he carries a
birch-rod for bad ones. In the more primitive sections,
such as certain parts of Lorraine, the Tyrol,
Bohemia and so on, he is attended by an evil spirit
called Ruprecht who looks after bad boys and girls.</p>

<p>It is also frequently the custom on Christmas Day
for a couple or more of maskers to dress themselves
up as Saint Nicholas and Ruprecht, and other
attendants, such as the Christ-child or St. Peter or
who not,—these additional characters varying with
the locality. They go from house to house rewarding
the good children and punishing the bad.</p>

<small>A TERRIBLE CHRISTMAS IN OLD FRANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Forever</span> memorable as an illustration of the manners
of the French court in the fourteenth century
stands a terrible accident that happened in Paris on
the Christmas eve of 1393. All through the Christmas
ceremonies of the preceding week riot had run
unchecked. The wildest spirits of the French court
had been given a free rein. One mad prank had followed
another, until it might seem that imagination
had been exhausted in the effort at inventing new
follies.</p>

<p>But this would have been reckoning without Sir
Hugonin de Guisay. Sir Hugonin was known as
the maddest of the mad. The reckless and the ungodly
loved and admired him as much as the sober
and the godly hated and despised him. From his
height as a nobleman of the French court he looked
down with contempt on “the common people,”—tradesmen,
mechanics, laborers and servants. He
found a cruel pleasure in accosting harmless folk of
this sort in the public streets, pricking them with his
spurs, lashing them with his whip, and ordering them
to creep on their hands and feet in the gutters.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“Bark, dog, bark!” he would cry as he cracked his
whip in the air.</p>

<p>To please him the victims had to bow-wow and
growl like curs ere this polite and pleasant gentleman
would allow them to rise from their degraded position.</p>

<p>On this particular Christmas Eve Sir Hugonin
had a proposal to make. He suggested that, in order
to continue the festivities, a mock marriage should be
celebrated between a gentleman and a lady of the
court. The proposal was accepted with shouts of
joy. A young couple were chosen to stand up before
a pretended priest, and to go through the form of the
wedding service.</p>

<p>Just as the ceremony was nearing its end Sir
Hugonin asked the king and four of his courtiers,—madcaps
all of them and all of them members of the
proudest families in France,—to withdraw with him
for a moment. He had a fresh proposal to make.
It happened that at this time all Paris had gone wild
over the dancing bears brought into the capital by
strolling performers. Hugonin’s plan was that he
and the king, and the four courtiers, should disguise
themselves as dancing bears. A pot of tar and a
quantity of tow were ready at hand to transform
them into fair imitations of the bears in the players’
booths. Then the five courtiers were to be bound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
together with a silk rope. The king himself would
lead them into the hall.</p>

<p>“Excellent!” cried the king and all the courtiers,
save only Sir Evan de Foix.</p>

<p>Sir Evan seems to have been the one man of the
party who had preserved a glimmer of common sense.
He pointed out that they were about to rush into a
room full of lights. Being all bound together, no
one could say what disaster might not befall.</p>

<p>“Sire,” he pleaded, “it is certain that if one of us
catches fire, the whole number, including your Majesty,
will be as so many roast chestnuts.”</p>

<p>Then up spoke the reckless Sir Hugonin. “Who
is to set us on fire?” he asked. “Where is there the
traitor that would not be careful when the safety of
the king is at stake?”</p>

<p>Sir Evan’s fears could not be set at rest. But when
he found that the counsels of Sir Hugonin were
bound to prevail he suggested that at least all due
precautions should be taken.</p>

<p>“Let His Majesty be prevailed upon at least to give
orders that nobody bearing a torch shall approach
us.”</p>

<p>“That shall be done at once,” said Charles. Instantly
sending for the chief officer in charge of the
hall he gave instructions that all the torchbearers
should be collected together on one side of the room,
and that under no pretence should any of them approach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
a party of savage men who were about to
enter and perform a dance. These orders having
been given the dancers entered.</p>

<p>They were greeted with a roar of laughter and
cheers. The mimic bears followed their leader around
the hall saluting the ladies as they passed them, and
leaping and dancing for the amusement of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” cried the spectators, eager to penetrate
the disguise.</p>

<p>Now just at this moment it unfortunately happened
that the Duke of Orleans made his appearance
at the doors of the hall. He knew nothing of what
had been going on behind the scenes. He was attended
by six torchbearers, who in obedience to orders,
should not have been admitted into the dance-hall.
But the Duke of Orleans was the king’s brother. It
was hard to dictate to the first prince of the blood.
He could scarcely be included in any general order.
So he was allowed to pass in with his companions.</p>

<p>“Who are they?” he exclaimed, taking up the cry
that was ringing around the hall. “Well, we shall
soon find out.”</p>

<p>Snatching a brand from one of his torchbearers
he peered into the faces of the dancers, seeking to
identify them. Coming at last to Sir Evan de Foix,
he shouted out his name, and caught him by the arm.
Sir Evan tried to shake himself free. But the Duke
would not loosen his hold. Just then some one jostled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
his elbows and the torch he held in his hand was
brought into sudden contact with the tarry tow that
did duty as a bearskin. In one moment Sir Evan
was blazing from head to foot. In another moment
the whole group of knights were aflame. Their frantic
struggles served only to draw them more closely
together within the silken rope that bound them.</p>

<p>Luckily for the king he had detached himself from
the group, having stopped on his rounds to talk to
the Duchess de Berri. When first the alarm was
given he would have rushed to help his companions,
but the duchess, guessing it was the king under this
disguise, threw her arms around him and forcibly
detained him.</p>

<p>“Sire,” she said, “do you not see that your companions
are burning to death, and that nothing could
save you if you went near them in that dress?”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one of the maskers had wrenched himself
free from his companions. This was the young
Lord of Nantouillet, famous for strength, agility
and presence of mind, possessed, moreover, of a powerful
jaw and a splendid set of teeth. He bit through
the silken rope that enmeshed him, wrenched it off,
and then rushed through the hall and flung himself,
like a blazing comet, through a window that opened
into the yard below. Luckily he had remembered that
underneath the window stood a cistern full of water.
Plunging headlong into this impromptu bathtub
he emerged, black, burnt and sizzling, but saved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>As for his companions, they were now whirling
hither and thither through a horrified mob of spectators,
who trampled over each other in their eagerness
to escape contact with the blaze. Shrieking, praying,
cursing, the doomed four fought with the flames and
with one another. Women fainted; men who had
never faltered in the fiercest battle sickened at the
frightful spectacle. Eager as they would have been
to assist their friends, the men knew only too well that
no human arm could offer assistance.</p>

<p>All Paris had been aroused by the tumult and now
crowded around the palace gates. At last the flames
burned out. The four maskers lay, a charred and
writhing heap, upon the floor of the dance-hall. One
was a mere cinder. Another survived until daybreak.
Still another died at noon the next day. The fourth
lived on through three days of agony. This was Sir
Hugonin himself.</p>

<p>Small pity did he get from the mechanics and
tradesmen of Paris!</p>

<p>“Bark, dog, bark!” was the cry with which they
greeted the charred and mangled corpse when it was
borne through the streets to its final resting place in
the cemetery.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN LEGEND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have seen that most of the ceremonies that
have attended or still attend the season of Christmas
may be traced back to a period long before the birth
of Christ.</p>

<p>The Christmas tree is no exception to this rule.
It is pagan, not Christian in its origin, though it has
been adapted to Christian uses. It came down to us
from the pagan Teutons and Scandinavians, and on
the way it was Christianized in Germany and Holland,
in Sweden, Norway and Denmark, long before
it had been made holy in the same manner among
the English-speaking peoples.</p>

<p>Myth and history have both busied themselves with
guesses at its origin. Let us begin with myth.</p>

<p>A very old legend makes Saint Winfred the inventor
of the Christmas tree. Winfred (please note
that this is the masculine form of which Winifred
is the feminine) was one of the early missionaries to
Norway who helped to wean the ancient Scandinavians
from their pagan beliefs and practices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>He found that their priests, the Druids, had taught
them to worship trees as if they were living gods.
So he set himself the task of showing to his Christian
converts that the objects of their former worship were
not gods but trees,—trees and nothing more. On
Christmas eve, therefore, he hewed down a mighty
oak in presence of a great crowd of men, women and
children.</p>

<p>A miracle indeed followed. But it was a Christian
miracle, and as such was all the more convincing
to these simple people that their old-time faiths had
been misplaced.</p>

<p>This is how the miracle is described by an ancient
historian:</p>

<p>“As the bright blade circled around Winfred’s
head, and the flakes of wood flew from the deepening
gash in the body of the tree, a whirling wind passed
over the forest. It gripped the oak from its foundations.
Backward it fell like a tower, groaning as
it split asunder in four pieces. But just behind it
and unharmed by the ruin, stood a young fir tree
pointing a green spire towards the stars.</p>

<p>“Winfred let the axe drop and turned to speak to
the people.</p>

<p>“‘This little tree, a young child of the forest, shall
be your holy tree to-night. It is the wood of peace,
for your houses are built of the fir. It is a sign of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
endless life, for its leaves are ever green. See how
it points upward to heaven. Let this be called the
tree of the Christ-child; gather about it, not in the
wildwood, but in your own homes; there it will shelter
no deeds of blood, but loving gifts and rites of kindness.’”</p>

<p>There is another old legend that is told by the
people around Strassburg, a famous old city on the
Rhine. Half way between this city and the neighboring
town of Drusenheim there are still to be seen
the ruins of an old castle. It probably dates back
to the seventh century. Its chief feature is a massive
gate. Deep sunk in the stone arch above this gate,
and as clearly and sharply defined as if it had been
carved only yesterday, is the impress of a small and
delicate hand. And this is the story that is told to
account for the presence of the hand.</p>

<p>One of the early lords of the castle was Count Otto
von Gorgas, a handsome and dashing youth, whose
great delight was hunting big game. So devoted,
indeed, was he to the shooting of deer and the spearing
of wild boars that love could find no entrance
into his heart. In vain did the fairest maidens in
the land sigh for a soft speech or a tender glance
from this wild huntsman. Mothers on both banks of
the river Rhine had abandoned in despair all hope of
securing him as a match for their daughters, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
the daughters themselves had spitefully given him
the name of Stony-heart, by which he had become
generally known throughout the country side.</p>

<p>But Count Otto only laughed at the anger of the
ladies, and continued to kill with his own hand such
large quantities of game that new servants would not
come into his employ, unless he had first agreed to
give them venison or wild boar steaks not oftener
than four days in the week.</p>

<p>One Christmas Eve Count Otto ordered that a battue
or monster hunt should take place in the forest
surrounding his castle. So exciting was the sport
that he was led deep into the thickets and at night-fall
found himself separated from all his friends and followers.
He reined up beside a far-away spring, clear
and deep, known to the country people as the Fairy’s
Well. His hands being stained with the blood of
the wild animals he had slain, he dismounted from his
horse to wash them in the spring.</p>

<p>Though the weather was cold and a white frost
covered the dead leaves, Count Otto found to his
surprise that the water of the well was warm and
pleasant. A delightful feeling ran through his veins.
Plunging his arms deeper into the well, he fancied that
he felt his right hand grasped by another hand softer
and smaller than his own, which gently drew from his
finger a gold ring that he was accustomed to wear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>Sure enough, when he pulled his hand out of the
water the ring was gone!</p>

<p>Though annoyed by his loss, the count decided that
the ring had accidentally slipped from his finger.
There was no opportunity for any further search that
day, for the well was very deep and the sun had
already set.</p>

<p>So Otto remounted his horse and rode back to the
castle, resolving that in the morning he would have
the Fairy’s Well emptied out by his servants. Little
doubt had he but that the ring would easily be found
at the bottom.</p>

<p>As a rule Count Otto was a good sleeper. That
night, however, he tried in vain to close his eyes. Lying
restlessly awake he listened feverishly to the hoarse
baying of the watch-dog in the court-yard until near
midnight. Suddenly he raised himself on his elbows.
What was that unusual noise he heard outside?</p>

<p>He strained his ears. Distinctly he again heard
the creaking of the drawbridge as it was being lowered.
A few minutes later there followed sounds
as of the pattering of many feet up the stone stairs
and into the chamber next to his own. Then a wild
strain of music came floating on the air, shooting a
sweet mysterious thrill even into his “stony” heart.</p>

<p>Rising softly from his bed, Otto hastily dressed
himself. A little bell sounded. His chamber door
was suddenly flung open. He accepted what seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
like a wordless invitation. Crossing the threshold
into the next room, he found himself in the midst of
an assemblage of rather small but very lovely looking
strangers of both sexes, who laughed, chatted, danced
and sang without seeming in the least to notice him.</p>

<p>In the middle of the room stood a splendid Christmas
tree from which a great number of many-colored
lamps shed a flood of light throughout the apartment.</p>

<p>Now this was the first Christmas tree that had ever
been seen in those parts, or indeed by any mortal
folk in any portion of the world. And it was a
Christmas tree of a sort that never again has been
seen by any mortal folk in any portion of the
world.</p>

<p>For surely never again has a Christmas tree borne
such fruits. Instead of toys and candies the branches
were hung with diamond stars and crosses, pearl necklaces,
aigrettes of rubies and sapphires, baldricks embroidered
with Oriental pearls, and daggers mounted
in gold and studded with the rarest gems.</p>

<p>Lost in wonder at a scene he could not understand,
the count gazed without the power of uttering a
single word. There was a sudden movement at the
end of the hall. The company stopped dancing and
fell back to make way for a newcomer. Then in the
bright rays of the Christmas lights, a dazzling vision
stood in front of Count Otto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>It was a princess of astonishing beauty. Though
only a girl in size, she was a woman in age. Though
small, her body was exquisitely formed. There she
stood, magnificently dressed as for a ball. A diadem
sparkled amid her raven black locks, rich point lace
only half veiled her snowy bosom, and her dress of
rose-colored silk sat close to her slender figure, falling
in folds just so low as to reveal the neatest feet and
ankles in the world, while her sleeves were short
enough to display beautiful arms of dazzling whiteness.</p>

<p>The charming stranger showed no awkward timidity.
On the contrary, after a short pause she walked
straight up to the count, caught him by both hands,
and said, in the sweetest of voices:</p>

<p>“Dear Otto, I am come to return your call.”</p>

<p>At the same time she raised her right hand to his
lips. Forgetting all his old coldness towards the
female sex he gallantly kissed it without making any
other reply. Indeed, he felt fascinated, spellbound.
He gladly let the beautiful stranger draw him to a
couch where she sat herself down besides him. Her
lips met his and before he could think about kissing
them, he had done so.</p>

<p>“My dear friend,” whispered the lady into his ear,
“I am the fairy Ernestine. I have brought you a
Christmas present. That which you lost and hardly
hoped to find again, see! I fetch it back to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>And, drawing from her bosom a little casket set
with diamonds, she placed it in the hands of the count.
He eagerly opened it. Not entirely unexpectedly
(for had not her words forewarned him?) he found
within it the ring that he had lost in the forest well.</p>

<p>Carried away by a feeling as strange as it was irresistible,
Count Otto pressed the casket and then the
lovely Ernestine to his breast.</p>

<p>“Delightful,” murmured the maiden, who as you
may see, was not so coy as are many maidens of the
everyday world.</p>

<p>In brief the two had fallen in love with each other
at first sight. Before they parted for the night, Otto
had won the fairy’s consent to become his wife.</p>

<p>One thing only she demanded of him. He must
never make use of the word “death” in her presence.
Fairies are immortal; she did not wish to be reminded
that she was bound to a mortal husband.</p>

<p>It was easy enough for him to make this promise,
and no doubt he thought it would be easy to keep it.
Next day Count Otto von Gorgas and Ernestine,
the Queen of the Fairies, were married with great
pomp and ceremony. They lived happily together
for some years in the grand old castle.</p>

<p>One day it chanced that the young couple were to
assist at a great tourney in the neighborhood. The
Lady Ernestine’s horse stood in waiting for her at the
castle gate. Being greatly occupied in adjusting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
new headdress which her milliner had just brought
home, she kept her husband waiting until his patience
was worn out.</p>

<p>“Fair dame,” he pettishly exclaimed when she at
last appeared in the great hall where for half an hour
he had been striding up and down in his uncomfortable
armor, “you are so long making ready, you would
be a good messenger to send for Death.”</p>

<p>Scarcely had he uttered the fatal word than with a
wild scream the lady disappeared. She left no trace
behind her, except the print of her little hand above
the castle gate. Every Christmas eve, however, she
returns and flits about the ruins with loud lamentations,
crying at intervals:</p>

<p>“Death! Death! Death!”</p>

<p>As to Count Otto he went the way of all flesh and
was gathered to his fathers not long after he had lost
his spouse. But every Christmas Eve, while his life
lasted, he would set up a lighted tree in the hall where
he had first met the lady Ernestine,—in the vain hope
of wooing her back to his arms. And this, it is said
in Strasburg and its neighborhood, was the origin of
the Christmas tree.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<small>THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN HISTORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> stories I have just told you are pretty enough
and may amuse an idle half hour. But we must now
pass from the region of myth into that of history and
science.</p>

<p>My sexagenarian readers will not need to be introduced
to the science called comparative mythology.
But for the sake of the six year olds it may be well to
explain, as simply as I can in a few words, that comparative
mythology is a branch of human knowledge
which compares the myths and legends of one age
and one people with the myths and legends of another
age and another people, the object being to show how
the later myths descend from the earlier ones, or how
all the myths go back to some parent germ in the
far-away past.</p>

<p>By the aid, then, of the science of comparative
mythology let us seek to study the historical growth
of the idea that is now embodied in the Christmas
tree. Here, indeed, we are in a whirl of problems.
Comparative mythology is one of the most interesting
and also one of the most difficult of sciences. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
the present case it must take account of the fact that
we English-speaking peoples of the present day, and
especially we Americans, are a hodge-podge mixture
of many races and many religions. Somewhere in
our brains we preserve dim memories of a thousand
conflicting myths of the past which without knowing
it we have inherited from our ancestors. In other
parts of our brain we retain the facts and fictions
which have been told to us by our elders, or which
we have learned from books.</p>

<p>Now in all times and in all countries we find records
of the worship, at some former period, of a tree as
a divinity,—in other words as a god.</p>

<p>Greatest and most famous of all these sacred trees
was a quite imaginary one which the Scandinavians
called the ash-tree Yggdrasil. Nobody had ever seen
it, but everybody among these imaginative people believed
in its existence.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be a tree so big that you could
not possibly picture it to your fancy, which encompassed
the entire universe of sun and moon and stars
and earth. And it had three roots, one in heaven, one
in hell and one on earth.</p>

<p>The serpent who gnaws the roots of Yggdrasil
was of course a heathen idea. Yet you cannot help
seeing in him some likeness to the serpent of Genesis
who is held to be a symbol of Satan, or the devil.
Like Satan he seeks the destruction of the universe.
When the roots of Yggdrasil are eaten through the
tree will fall over and the end of all things will have
arrived.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101-102]</span>

<figure class="figcenter illowe31_25" id="i_101">
<img class="w100" src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="Luther and the Christmas tree"><br>
<figcaption class="caption">

<p class="caption">Luther and the Christmas tree.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Now among the Anglo-Saxons or early inhabitants
of England, who were in part descended from the
Scandinavians, Yggdrasil survived in the Yule log,
which they used to burn on Christmas Eve, as it is
still burned in many an English home to-day.</p>

<p>And this is how the pagan tree was transformed
into the Christian Yule log:—</p>

<p>The missionaries to the Anglo-Saxons denounced
the Yggdrasil superstition. They made their converts
hack to pieces all carved figures representing
the idolatrous symbol, and then cast the pieces into
the flames as a token that the Christ-child had destroyed
heathenism.</p>

<p>Among the Germans and the Norsemen, however,
the sanctity of the Yggdrasil myth could not be destroyed.
It had to be transformed, and transferred
to Christian uses by identifying it with some Christian
or Jewish symbol like the tree of life in Genesis
or the cross of Christ in the New Testament.</p>

<p>Compare the great tree Yggdrasil and its three
roots with the description which a certain writer of
the early middle ages, called Alcima, gives of the
Tree of Life.</p>

<p>“It’s position,” says Alcima, “is such that the upper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
portion touches the earth, the root reaches to hell,
and the branches extend to all parts of the earth.”</p>

<p>Evidently Alcima had been influenced by Scandinavian
legend as well as by biblical lore. Of course
you will understand that he was speaking not of the
actual cross, but of the cross as a symbol of Christianity.</p>

<p>Let us extend our researches a little further into
the region of comparative mythology.</p>

<p>You will find Adam and Eve commemorated in
old calendars under date of December 24th. This
is the eve of Christmas. The symbol of our first parents
is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
Christmas itself is the day of Christ, whose symbol
is the tree of life or the cross. It is easy to see that
when the minds of men were escaping from paganism
into Christianity the tree of the old mythology grew
to be associated with the birthday of Christ and thus
with the cross. So the lights of the Chanuckah Festival
of the Hebrews were borrowed to adorn the
sacred tree, and the seven-branched candlestick, as
a figure of that tree, was even introduced into the
churches.</p>

<p>The representation—so common among the early
painters and especially the painters of Italy—of the
serpent squatting at the foot of the cross had of course
its Christian meaning, but its adoption into Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
art was in great degree influenced by the fact that
the cross had become popularly identified with the
serpent tree of the old pagan myth.</p>

<p>Scandinavia was not the only place that had its
sacred tree. Egypt, for instance, had one in the palm,
which puts forth a shoot every month. A spray of
this tree with twelve shoots on it was used in ancient
Egypt at the time of the winter solstice as a symbol
of the twelvemonth or completed year.</p>

<p>From Egypt the custom reached Rome, where
it was added to the other ceremonies of the Saturnalia.
But as palm trees do not grow in Italy other trees
were used in its stead. A small fir tree, or the crest
of a large one was found to be the most suitable,
because it is shaped like a cone or a pyramid. This
was decorated with twelve burning tapers lit in honor
of the god of Time. At the very tip of the pyramid
blazed the representation of a radiant sun placed there
in honor of Apollo, the sun-god, to whom the three
last days of December were dedicated. These days
were called the sigillaria, or seal-days, because presents
were then made of impressions stamped on wax.</p>

<p>In further honor of Apollo, who was a shepherd
in his youth, images of sheep were shown pasturing
under the tree. Apollo himself sometimes took
charge of the herd, or taught the shepherds the use
of the musical pipe. All these customs were skilfully
adapted by the priests of the early Church to Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
uses. Shepherd and sheep were retained as
symbols of Christ and his flock. As you know, our
Lord is frequently alluded to as the good shepherd
and is so represented in religious paintings. The
sigillaria of the old Romans were also turned to a
new use, the wax being now stamped with figures of
saints and other holy persons.</p>

<p>A few pages back you were told that the day before
Christmas is the day which our pious forefathers
dedicated to Adam and Eve. Hence, you will remember,
figures of our first parents appeared at the
foot of the tree, while a serpent entwined itself
around the roots or the trunk. This was the serpent
of the Old Testament, but I have already explained
how it was also a Christian adaptation of the serpent
of the great ash-tree Yggdrasil.</p>

<p>I may add, right here, that the serpent still makes
its appearance at the base of a Christmas tree in many
parts of rural Germany where old customs still survived
in their original purity.</p>

<p>And now by grouping all these facts together we
find that long before the coming of Christ there was
scattered all over the world an idea that an illuminated
tree was a symbol of holiness. Therefore it was only
natural that it came at last to be associated with the
birthday of Christ and with the period of the winter
solstice which the followers of Christ had rescued
from pagan practices and pagan superstitions and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
adapted to the religion which He had founded.</p>

<p>This association was made all the more natural
because the candles that twinkle on the Christmas tree
were anticipated in the candles lit by the Jews on their
Chanuckah or Feast of Lights. Chanuckah is still
celebrated among them with all the old forms. It
falls on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev, or ninth month
of the Jewish calendar, which roughly corresponds
with our December or twelfth month.</p>

<p>On that day, in the year 165 before Christ, the temple
in Jerusalem, which had been desecrated by a
Roman army under Antiochus, had been purified and
rededicated by Judas Maccabeus. Antiochus had
put out the lights of the seven-branched candelabra
that had been kept burning ever since the temple had
been finished. A jar of sacred oil, sealed with the
ring of the High Priest, was discovered untouched.
There seemed to be only enough for one day but
when it was poured into the lamp it lasted for a
full week. This miracle happened just in the nick of
time, for it would have taken seven days to obtain
a fresh supply of oil. It was then decreed that the
week beginning with the twenty-fifth day of Kislev
should be celebrated as a festival forever.</p>

<p>Accordingly on that day in every year the Jews
light a candle in every home, on the next day, two,
and so on, until the seventh and last day of the feast
when seven candles twinkle in every home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>Now if Christ was born on the twenty-fifth day
of December he probably came into the world at a
time when every house in Bethlehem and Jerusalem
was ablaze with lights.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be added that one of the
German names for Christmas is Weihnacht or Night
of Dedication, as though it were somehow associated
in the popular mind with the Jewish Chanuckah.
Another curious fact which bears out the same theory
is that the Catholics of the Greek Church call Christmas
the Feast of Lights.</p>

<p>With another Jewish festival Christmas has a verbal
link. This is the feast of the Passover when a
lamb is killed and eaten. Christ is often symbolized
as a lamb. Saint John the Baptist, you remember,
greeted him as “the Lamb of God who taketh
away the sins of the world.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN EUROPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have now considered the far-off origins of
the Christmas tree. We have decided that it is an
adaptation of the Yggdrasil and other sacred trees
of the pagan past to Christian and modern uses. Not
yet, however, have we bridged the chasm that divides
the history of the old tree from that of the new
one.</p>

<p>How, where and by whom was the Christmas tree,
as we now know it, brought into the Christmas festivities
and associated with the Christ-child and Saint
Nicholas? I am sorry to say that it is impossible to
give positive answers to any of these questions.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, a very popular German tradition
which makes Martin Luther the inventor of the modern
Christmas tree. One bright Christmas eve, it is
said, as Luther was journeying home through a snow-covered
country, he was more than ever struck by the
wondrous spectacle of the star-lit sky above him.</p>

<p>It is a very common saying, one which dates back
to an old Greek philosopher but which has been repeated
by many other wise men of modern times,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
that if a grown person who had all his life gone to
bed with the setting sun and got up with the rising
one, and who, therefore, had never seen the moon or
the stars, were suddenly to be awakened at midnight,
he would be overwhelmed by the glorious mystery
of the spectacle overhead. We who are accustomed
to the sight from our cradles can hardly realize the
shock of such a surprise. Because we have seen
the moon and stars ever since we could remember
we forget how wonderful they are, and how beautiful
is the scene they present. We take them as a matter
of course.</p>

<p>Now Martin Luther was a poet as well as a
preacher. One great difference between a poet and
an ordinary person of slower imagination is that he
adds to the wisdom of manhood the freshness and
simplicity of childhood. He retains the young heart
with the mature brain. As Carlyle, a great modern
writer, has said, he sees the world “rimmed around
with wonder.” Carlyle being, like Martin Luther, a
poet, even though he rarely put his thoughts into
verse and rhyme, never lost the sense of wonder and
awe towards the manifestations of God in the universe.</p>

<p>God is everywhere, though we poor, purblind
folk only now and then catch glimpses of Him. If
we could clear away the mists that have gathered
round our eyes during our progress through the world
we would know that He is everywhere. It is the
poet who keeps his eyes clearest for the Blessed
Vision.</p>

<p class="caption">Christmas tree of the English royal family.<br>

<small>From the “Illustrated London News,” December, 1842.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>Luther arrived at home, so the story continues,
with brain and heart full of the feelings and the
thoughts that had been inspired in him by the firmament
of shining stars. He tried to explain to his
wife and children just what those thoughts and feelings
were. Suddenly an idea struck him. Going
into the garden he cut off a little fir tree, dragged
it into the nursery, put some candles into its branches
and lighted them. Ever after that, we are told,
Luther fixed up a Christmas tree in his home for
the instruction and entertainment of his wife and
children. The custom was imitated by his neighbors
and finally spread all over Germany.</p>

<p>This is a very pretty legend, but it is legend and
not history. It deserves no more credit than the story
of St. Winfred which I have quoted from German
folk-lore, or the fairy tale which, as I have said,
still lingers among the people in and around Strasburgh.</p>

<p>All that we know from real history is that a tree
with lighted candles was now and then used in the
middle ages, and later, in connection with the Christmas
rejoicings.</p>

<p>Such a tree is known to have played its part in a
Christmas pageant given at the court of Henry VIII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
in England. The tree is described at some length in
the chronicles of the time, but it is evident from these
descriptions that it lacked the chief feature of the
modern one. It was not a bearer of presents.</p>

<p>So far as it is possible to gather from history, the
Christmas tree, as we know it to-day, made its first
appearance in Strassburgh. This is interesting in
view of the fact that one of the earliest legends in
explanation of the custom finds its home in that city.
More authentic witness is afforded by an old manuscript
still preserved in a library at Friedburg, Germany,
which was written by a citizen of Strassburgh
in the year 1608. This manuscript speaks of a tree
all alight with candles and bedecked with presents as
being a regular feature of the Christmas festivities
of that time. Therefore we are sure that the Christmas
tree had come into common use in this region
by the beginning of the seventeenth century. Further
than that there is no certainty.</p>

<p>The custom appears to have spread from Strassburgh
to the neighboring cities along the Rhine and
to have flourished in that limited district for fully
two hundred years.</p>

<p>Suddenly, about the beginning of the nineteenth
century, it made its appearance outside of the Rhenish
towns in other nearby localities, until finally it had
invaded the whole of Germany. Fifty years later
it had conquered nearly all Christendom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>In the year 1825 the English poet, Samuel Taylor
Coleridge, visited Germany to spend the winter
months in that country. One of his letters written in
the following January speaks of the Christmas tree
as something entirely unknown to his fellow countrymen.</p>

<p>“There is a Christmas custom here,” he says,
“which pleased and interested me. The children
make little presents to their parents and to each other
and the parents to their children. For three or four
months before Christmas the girls are all busy and
the boys save up their pocket money to buy these
presents. What the present is to be is cautiously
kept secret; and the girls have a world of contrivances
to conceal it—such as working when they are out on
visits, and the others are not with them; getting up
in the morning before daylight and so forth. Then,
on the evening before Christmas day, one of the
parlors is lighted up by the children, into which the
parents must not go; a great yew-bough is fastened
on the table at a little distance from the wall, a multitude
of little tapers are fixed in the bough, but not
so as to burn it till they are nearly consumed, and
colored paper, etc., hangs and flutters from the twigs.</p>

<p>“Under this bough the children lay out, in great
order, the presents they mean for their parents, still
concealing in their pockets what they intend for each
other. Then the parents are introduced and each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
presents his little gift; they then bring out the remainder,
one by one, from their pockets, and present
them with kisses and embraces. Where I witnessed
this scene, there were eight or nine children, and the
oldest daughter and the mother wept aloud for joy
and tenderness; and the tears ran down the face of
the father, and he clasped all his children so tight
to his breast, it seemed as if he did it to stifle the
sob that was rising within it. I was very much
affected. The shadow of the bough and its appendages
on the wall, and arching over on the ceiling, made
a pretty picture; and then the raptures of the very little
ones, when at last the twigs and their needles began
to take fire and snap—O! it was a delight to
them!</p>

<p>“On the next day (Christmas day) in the great
parlor, the parents lay out on the table the presents
for the children; a scene of more sober joy succeeds;
as on this day, after an old custom, the mother says
privately to each of her daughters and the father to
his sons, that which he has observed most praise-worthy
and that which was most faulty in their conduct.”</p>

<p>Continuing, Coleridge tells us that formerly, and
still in all the smaller towns and villages throughout
North Germany, these presents were sent by all the
parents to some young fellows, who, in high buskins,
a white robe, a mask, and an enormous flax wig personates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
Knecht Ruprecht, i. e. the servant Rupert.</p>

<p>“On Christmas night he goes round to every house,
and says that Jesus Christ, his Master, sent him
thither. The parents and elder children receive him
with great pomp and reverence, while the little ones
are most terribly frightened. He then inquires for
the children, and according to the character which
he hears from the parents, he gives them the intended
presents, as if they came out of heaven from Jesus
Christ, or if they should have been bad children, he
gives the parents a rod, and, in name of his Master,
recommends them to use it frequently. About seven
or eight years old, the children are let into the secret,
and it is curious how faithfully they keep it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE CHRISTMAS TREE IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Coleridge’s</span> letter, as we have seen, was written in
January 1826. In the succeeding December the
English people were to obtain a nearer view of the
Christmas tree. A great German lady, the Princess
Lieven, who had taken up her residence for a season
in London brought many German customs with her.</p>

<p>“On Christmas,” says Henry Greville, an amusing
gossip whose diary was published after his death, “the
Princess Lieven got up a little fête such as is customary
all over Germany. Three trees, in great pots,
were put upon a long table covered with pink linen.
Each tree was illuminated with three circular tiers
of colored wax candles,—blue, green, red and white.
Before each tree was displayed a quantity of toys,
gloves, pocket-handkerchiefs, work boxes, books and
various articles—presents made to the owner of the
tree. It was very pretty. Here it was only for the
children. In Germany the custom extends to persons
of all ages.”</p>

<p>Not yet, however, did the custom pass over to
England. The people who saw the tree in the parlor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
of the Princess Lieven or who heard about it from
those who had there seen it, made no attempt to copy
it in their own homes. A dozen years were to pass
before the tree took firm roots in English soil.</p>

<p>It was the marriage of Queen Victoria to a German
prince—Albert of Saxe-Coburg—that brought about
this result. The first child was a daughter (named
Victoria after her mother) who became Empress of
Germany and the mother of the present Emperor
William. The second child was a son, who is now
King Edward VII of England. When the Princess
Victoria was about five years old Prince Albert set
up a Christmas tree, German fashion, in the royal
nursery at Windsor Castle.</p>

<p>A writer in the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> places the date
of the introduction of the Christmas tree into England
as December 1841. He remembers, he says,
when his parents, “who had spent many winters in
Germany, first introduced it, some forty-five years
ago into England, what astonishment it created, what
surprised delight it afforded.”</p>

<p>This writer gives a little too much credit to his parents.
No mere subjects of the queen could have made
other people follow so readily in their footsteps. The
royal example, however, was sufficient. Once a
Christmas tree had been set up in Windsor Castle,
you may be sure that Christmas trees blazed and
twinkled in every British household that could afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
one. It has remained ever since just what it is with
us,—the centre of all the Christmas festivities.</p>

<p>From the <i>London News</i> for December, 1848, I
have taken a picture which represents the Windsor
Castle Christmas tree with the English royal family
of that date grouped around it. It is interesting to
note how this English paper deals with the novelty
recently brought over from Germany.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The tree employed for this festive purpose,” says the
<i>News</i>, “is a young fir about eight feet high, and has six tiers
of branches. On each tier, or branch, are arranged a dozen
wax tapers. Pendent from the branches are elegant trays,
baskets, <i>bonbonnières</i>, and other receptacles for sweetmeats, of
the most varied and expensive kind; and of all forms, colours,
and degrees of beauty. Fancy cakes, gilt gingerbread and
eggs filled with sweetmeats, are also suspended by variously-coloured
ribbons from the branches. The tree, which stands
upon a table covered with white damask, is supported at the
root by piles of sweets of a larger kind, and by toys and dolls
of all descriptions, suited to the youthful fancy, and to the
several ages of the interesting scions of Royalty for whose
gratification they are displayed. The name of each recipient
is affixed to the doll, bonbon, or other present intended for it,
so that no difference of opinion in the choice of dainties may
arise to disturb the equanimity of the illustrious juveniles.
On the summit of the tree stands the small figure of an angel,
with outstretched wings, holding in each hand a wreath.”</p>
</div>

<p>The tree, we are further told, was an object of
much interest to all visitors at Windsor Castle from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
Christmas Eve, when it was first set up, until Twelfth
Night, when it was taken down. Other trees were
placed in other rooms of the castle. Prince Albert
had his, which was decorated and hung with presents
by Queen Victoria, who in her turn received a tree
furnished in the same manner by her consort.</p>

<p>Two trees also stood on the sideboard of the royal
dining room and presented, we are told, “a brilliant
appearance when all the tapers are lighted up among
the branches.”</p>

<p>In America the Christmas tree had become a fixture
long before its appearance in England. German emigrants
to our shores had brought it over with them,
just as in earlier times the Dutch settlers of New
York had brought over Santa Klaus. But it flourished
in German settlements alone for many years
before it was adopted by their neighbors, the northern
descendants of the English Puritans and Pilgrims,
or the southern descendants of the English Cavaliers.</p>

<p>New York, as the great landing place for emigrants
and also as a city whose Dutch beginnings
had given it a leaning towards the Teutonic
spirit, was the first spot in which the German Christmas
tree made a new home for itself. Gradually but
surely the custom spread to citizens of other than
German birth. Fathers of families got into the habit
every Christmas of going out into the forests surrounding
New York to cut a young spruce or fir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
tree for the holiday times. Or if they were rich
enough to employ men-servants, they sent out the
footman or the butler for this purpose.</p>

<p>It is said that a woodsman named Mark Carr, who
was born among the foothills of the Catskill Mountains
in the early part of the nineteenth century, was
the first to make a regular business of Christmas trees.
He had heard or read of the holiday festivities in the
great city of New York, where churches and private
parlors were hung with holly and hemlock leaves, and
a pine or a fir tree stood in the middle of the nursery,
covered with presents for the children.</p>

<p>It occurred to him that the young fir trees growing
on the mountain-sides all around his little country
home might be made use of for these holiday purposes.
He could run no great risks in making trial
of the idea. All he could lose was the time it took
him to chop the trees down and bring them into market
and the cost of a few days’ living in New York.</p>

<p>In December, 1851, he put his plan into practice.
Early in the month he and his boys loaded a couple
of great sleds with young trees cut down from the
neighboring forests, and having hitched a yoke of
oxen to each sled drove them through the deep snow
to the Hudson River at Catskill, whence the father
started with them to the city.</p>

<p>One old-fashioned silver dollar secured the use of
a strip of sidewalk on the corner of Greenwich and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
Vesey streets. Here the hopeful mountaineer arranged
his forest novelties for Christmas buyers. Nor
had he long to wait. Customers flocked to his corner.
Starting with moderate prices he soon raised them,
as tree after tree left his hands, to sums that he would
have deemed fabulous when he first dreamed of the
experiment.</p>

<p>Next year he returned to the same place with a
much larger stock, and “from that time to this,” says
Hexamer, an old historian of New York, “business
has continued to exist until now hundreds of thousands
of trees are yearly sold from Mark Carr’s old corner.”</p>

<p>At the present day, Christmas tree choppers usually
begin work about the first of November. Thus they
avoid the early snow falls which are liable greatly
to increase the difficulties of the business by melting
and freezing again on the trees and making their
branches too brittle.</p>

<p>Firs and pines growing in open spaces are preferred
to those in dense woodlands because they are more
stocky and symmetrical. As the trees are felled the
woodsmen pile them up beside the forest roads, where
they will keep fresh and green for weeks or if necessary
for months.</p>

<p>The balsam fir is the favorite for Christmas trees
in the middle and eastern states. Its leaves retain
their color and elasticity longer than those of the black
spruce, of which large numbers are however shipped
into markets further south.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>THE STORY OF THE THREE KINGS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Latin countries, that is to say, in Italy and
the southernmost edge of France, Switzerland and
Austria, our good old friend Santa Klaus rarely acts
as the bearer of gifts at the Christmas season. Even
Russia, though she has adopted Saint Nicholas as her
patron saint, and celebrates his day in her own way,
gives him no special place in the festivities that attend
the birthday of Christ.</p>

<p>Indeed in all these countries it is not Christmas but
the Epiphany, not December 25th but January 6th,
which is the day on which presents are exchanged
among friends and relations.</p>

<p>Epiphany, best known among English-speaking
peoples as Twelfth Day, is the feast of the Three
Kings, who figure in the New Testament story as
the Magi or Wise Men of the East. You will undoubtedly
remember how these Wise Men were
warned of the birth of Christ by the appearance of
a strange star in the heavens, and how, by following
its guidance they arrived at the stable in Bethlehem
where the Savior had been born.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125-126]</span></p>

<p class="caption">On the way to Bethlehem.<br>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>They brought with them gifts of gold, frankincense
and myrrh which they presented to the Holy
Child.</p>

<p>It was in memory of the gift-bearing kings that
Epiphany among the Latin and Russian peoples is
celebrated as the season for exchanging presents.</p>

<p>Little is said in the New Testament about these
wise men. Popular legend has greatly filled out the
Biblical story. It makes them three rich and powerful
monarchs:—Caspar, King of Tarsus, the land of
myrrh; Melchior, King of Arabia, where the land is
ruddy with gold, and Balthasar, King of Saba, where
frankincense flows from the trees.</p>

<p>According to some authors these kings were of the
race of Balaam, the Old Testament prophet, who had
prepared the Gentiles for the coming of Christ into
the world. He had foretold that a new star should
appear in that part of the sky under which lay the
land of Judea, and had warned his descendants that
when they saw the star they should follow it and
should go to adore a great king who would be born
somewhere in Judea and be Lord of the Universe.</p>

<p>Even from the time of Balaam, it is added, sentinels
had been posted upon a mountain towards the
east, in order that as soon as the star rose into view
they should give notice of it to the lords of the country,
that the latter might go without delay to pay
reverence to the new king. This notice, as it happened,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
was not necessary in the case of Caspar, Melchior
and Balthasar. Being very wise and learned
kings they were under the special care of the Holy
Spirit, who informed them in person of the appearance
of the star.</p>

<p>Each of them at once gathered together a retinue of
servants, as well as troops of horses, camels and dromedaries,
all of which were laden with the choicest
products of their respective countries. Then they
started out in search of the new-born king. They
looked up to the star as their guide, for it moved
forward as they moved, and they well knew that it
had been sent to show them the way.</p>

<p>Where the three kings met is not told, but they
arrived in Jerusalem together. As soon as they had
entered the city gates the star which had guided them
disappeared.</p>

<p>Now this was in accordance with the will of God,—that
on the failure of their starry guide the kings
might make inquiries in the capital of Judea, and by
these means publish abroad the birth of the Son of
God. Hence Herod and the Jews in general could
have no excuse for ignoring this great event, and
“the care and diligence of the Magi would reprove
their negligence and indifference, because having
Christ so near them, they did not seek Him, while
these strangers came from distant countries for this
cause alone.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129-130]</span></p>

<p class="caption">The Three Kings visit Herod.<br>

<small>Painting by Sebastian Conea.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>And in fact the three kings, as they rode through
the streets of Jerusalem, asked of every one they met:</p>

<p>“Where is He who is born King of the Jews? We
have seen the star and have lost it.”</p>

<p>None could give them any information, for no
one in Jerusalem had seen the star.</p>

<p>One of the writers who tells this legend pauses to
praise the “holy boldness” with which the Magi published
a new king in Jerusalem without having fear
of Herod who might have been capable of putting
them to death for this cause. This writer quotes with
approval the words which Saint John Chrysostom
later addressed in imagination to the kings.</p>

<p>“Tell me, oh good kings, do you not know that
whoever proclaims a new king in the life of a reigning
king is liable to death, that you do this thing, and
thus place yourselves in manifest danger from Herod,
who may easily command you to be put to death?”</p>

<p>The same writer quotes with similar approval Saint
John’s answer to his own question:—</p>

<p>“The faith of these kings was so great and the
love they bore to the new-born King so fervent, that
even before they had seen Him they were ready to
die for love of Him.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The news of how three great kings, with a vast
following of servants and beasts of burden had arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
in Jerusalem soon reached the ears of King
Herod. He was greatly troubled when he heard
that they had come in quest of a new-born King of
the Jews, well knowing that the kingdom of Judea
did not belong to him by succession or by birth, but
that he had received it as a reward from the Romans,
who had unjustly taken possession of it.</p>

<p>The first thing he did was to call together all the
wise and learned men of Jerusalem, and ask them
what the prophets had said about the coming of the
Messiah, and the place where he would make his first
appearance on earth.</p>

<p>And when they answered that the babe would be
born in Bethlehem he was still more troubled. He
at once sent out messengers to invite the kings to his
palace, where he prepared a great banquet for them.
After they had feasted he advised them to continue
their journey as far as the little town of Bethlehem,
where they might come upon the object of their quest.</p>

<p>“If you find that the child of prophecy has been
born there,” he added, “hasten back and tell me the
joyful news that I, too, may come and worship Him.”</p>

<p>The kings promised to do as Herod bid them, little
knowing the guile and deceit that festered in his
wicked heart. Then they resumed their journey.</p>

<p>No sooner had they issued out of the gate of Jerusalem
than the star once more appeared in the sky, to
their great joy. Following it, they arrived at the
house where, thirteen days before, Christ had been
born.</p>

<p class="caption">The Journey of the Three Kings.<br>

<small>Painting by Andrea del Sarto.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Here the star stood still, burning even more brightly
than ever, as if to say,</p>

<p>“Here is He whom you seek; this is the palace of
the new-born King; this is the court of heaven, since
here its King has His abode.”</p>

<p>Strange and complex must have been the emotions
these wise men felt in their hearts when they saw what
the star showed them—this chamber of the King whom
they sought, a place more suitable for beasts than for
men; since not for men but for beasts had it been
prepared.</p>

<p>Within the stable the virgin mother was watching
over the manger, wherein lay her Divine Son. Her
quick ear caught the sound of footsteps and hoof-beats
outside the door. In great alarm she lifted
the Child out of the manger and encircled Him with
her arms. This was the attitude in which the three
kings, entering, found the mother and the Child.</p>

<p>The scales fell from their eyes at the sight. They
now realized that it was in truth no human king who
had been born into the world, but the King of Heaven
who had taken upon himself a human form. Throwing
themselves upon their knees, one by one they approached
him, and worshipped him as God and the
Savior of man.</p>

<p>Then they presented Him with their gifts which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
had now acquired a new meaning. Caspar’s gold testified
that the babe was a king, Melchior’s frankincense
showed that he was God, and Balthasar’s myrrh
was a reminder that he was a man and doomed to
suffer a painful death.</p>

<p>For gold was kept in kings’ treasuries, frankincense
was burnt in divine worship, and myrrh was used in
embalming the bodies of the dead.</p>

<p>The infant Jesus returned their offerings with
gifts more precious still. For gold He gave charity
and spiritual riches, for incense, faith, for myrrh,
truth and meekness.</p>

<p>That night the kings were warned in a dream that
they should not go back by way of Jerusalem because
King Herod cherished evil designs against the child
Jesus, but that they should return by other roads to
their own kingdoms. They obeyed in all meekness
and humility.</p>

<p>“From this arose the custom,” says the quaint old
author I have already quoted, “which the church observes
in processions, of leaving the church by one
road and returning to it by another. By this it would
be well that all Christians should learn from the Magi
not only to see Christ, but having found Him again,
even though they had lost Him, to return by a different
way from the other; because if at first they
walked in the ways of sin, they should return to it
by the ways of holiness; and in this country they will
arrive at the true country, which is heaven.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137-138]</span></p>

<p class="caption">The Arrival of the Three Kings.<br>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>When Herod found that the three kings had returned
home without fulfilling their promise to him he
was greatly wroth. It was then that he issued his edict
commanding that all children under the age of two
years should be put to death. He hoped that the
Messiah would be slaughtered among the rest. But,
as the New Testament tells us, the Holy Family received
a special warning from heaven and fled into
Egypt before the emissaries of wicked King Herod
could reach them.</p>

<p>As to the three kings, when they had arrived, each
at his own capital, they cast aside their royal robes and
abandoned their royal state. Giving all their goods
to the poor they wandered about the earth announcing
that the Savior of man had been born in Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Seven years after the death of Christ upon the
cross the wise men were found in India by Saint
Thomas, once the doubting disciple, now become firm
in the faith, and an apostle to the East. Saint
Thomas baptized them in the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and they too became
missionaries of the gospel. In the end they fell martyrs
for their faith and their bodies were all buried
together outside the walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Three hundred years passed away. Then Saint
Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine, made
her famous pilgrimage to Palestine. Though she
was quite eighty years of age she was still full of
life and vigor. All her time and energies she devoted
to the discovery of early Christian remains. She is
credited with the finding of the cross on which Christ
suffered and the tomb in which He was buried.</p>

<p>She also identified the tomb of the Three Kings and
carried their bodies away with her, on her return
journey to Constantinople, to re-bury them in the
church of Saint Sophia. Later the remains were
transferred to Milan and later still to Cologne.
There they are still shown, in a side chapel of the
great Cathedral, lying in a golden shrine—their grinning
skulls girt with golden crowns, and their skeleton
bodies clad in royal purple, bedecked with jewels
of enormous value.</p>

<p>This is the story of the Three Kings as it is related
all over Europe. In the Latin countries and in Russia,
an episode is added which is unknown in other
lands.</p>

<p>On their way from Jerusalem to Bethlehem, so this
added legend runs, the three kings came across an old
woman who was cleaning up her house.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141-142]</span>

<p class="caption">The Adoration of the Magi.<br>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>She asked them whither they were going. And
when they told her that they were on their way to
pay homage to the new-born King of the Jews she
prayed them to tarry until she had finished her task.</p>

<p>“Fain would I go with you,” she pleaded, “and
join in your homage.”</p>

<p>“Nay,” replied the kings, “we have no time to
wait. But leave your work and come with us.”</p>

<p>The old woman refused to leave her work until it
was all finished. Then it was too late. She strove,
indeed, to follow the kings, but they were lost to
sight.</p>

<p>Ever since that day she has been wandering about
the earth seeking for the child Jesus. And on the
eve of the Epiphany she comes down the chimneys
of the houses, leaving gifts for the little ones, as the
kings left gifts for the infant Jesus, and hoping
against hope that she may find Him whom she still
seeks.</p>

<p>In Italy she is known to this day as the Befana
(a corruption of Epiphania, the Italian for Epiphany)
and in Russia as the Baboushka or little old
woman.</p>

<p>On the eve of Epiphany, Italian children hang
up their clothes, after carefully emptying the pockets,
around the huge fireplaces which are common
both in palaces and in hovels. During the night the
Befana comes down the chimney, just like Santa
Klaus on Christmas eve. If the children have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
good, she stuffs their pockets full of candies and
other presents, but if they have been bad all they
get from her are charcoal ashes or birchrods.</p>

<p>In Spain, however, it is not the Befana nor the
Baboushka, but one of the three kings, no less a person
indeed than Balthazar, who is the gift bearer.
On the eve of the Epiphany children leave their shoes
and boots out in some convenient spot near the chimney,
expecting Balthazar will fill them during the
night.</p>

<p>From early times he has been represented as a
blackamoor or negro. But not from the earliest.
In the pictures by Giotto and Fra Angelico representing
the Adoration of the Magi, Balthazar is shown
as a white man. In a picture on the same subject
by Bernardo Luini he appears with the woolly hair,
black face and thick lips of the negro.</p>

<p>Somewhere between the time of Fra Angelico and
Bernardo Luini, Balthazar changed his skin and became
a colored gentleman.</p>

<p>In many Italian cities, it is the custom of shop-keepers
to decorate their windows with puppets meant
to represent the three kings. Conspicuous among
these grins the black face of Balthazar.</p>

<p>There is a poem by the famous Dean Trench
which was probably suggested by Luini’s picture.
Here are some of the most striking lines. They will
show you how closely the poem follows the picture:</p>

<small>SOME TWELFTH NIGHT CUSTOMS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Twelfth Night, or Epiphany, is a day dedicated
to the three Wise Men of the New Testament—the
three kings of popular legend—it is only natural that
one or more kings should be everywhere prominent
in the celebration of the holiday.</p>

<p>The full trio are present in many places. Thus in
Milan, Italy, three young men dress themselves up
in royal robes on Epiphany morning and mounting
horses as splendidly attired as themselves appear before
the city gates. They are admitted with loud
cheers, and a procession is formed. Before the kings
marches a man bearing a large gilt star; behind them
the citizens fall into line. At every street corner
new batches of citizens join the parade. They file
through the streets to the cathedral. At its steps the
kings dismount, and, with their followers, march up
the aisle to the high altar where a figure of the infant
Christ lies in a manger. Every one who wishes may
leave a present in the manger. Then the procession
disbands.</p>

<p>In Madrid a bit of practical joking is still indulged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
in on Epiphany eve. The peasants from miles around
flock into the city at that time. Many of them are
very ignorant and very superstitious. The town
folk think it funny to gather together in small crowds
all playing on noisy horns and thumping discordant
drums. The mobs parade up and down the streets.
Their great delight is to fall in with some simpleton
who is new to city ways. Such a man is easily made
to believe that they are on their way to meet the
three kings, who are expected to arrive at one of
the gates some time that night.</p>

<p>The mob urge the countryman to join them. If
he consents they throw over his neck a mule collar
with a string of bells attached to it. Then a step
ladder is thrust into his hands. To the jingling of
his own bells the poor yokel is made to carry the
ladder through the streets. At every one of the gates
of the city the mob halt and command their victim
to climb up the ladder and peer over the walls to see
if the kings are anywhere in sight.</p>

<p>Sometimes when he reaches the top the poor wretch
is allowed to fall, at the risk of a cracked head or a
broken limb. If he escapes all dangers, he is led
on from gate to gate until his patience or his faith
is exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>In England, as well as in France, a single king
survives in the ceremony of the Twelfth Cake.
France, which was probably the inventor of this eatable,
known there as the King’s Cake, cherishes the
custom with especial gusto. So let us begin with the
Galette du Roi.</p>

<p>The size of the cake is determined by the number of
the guests for whom it is to be served. It is usually
made of pastry and is baked in a round sheet like a pie.
A broad bean was formerly baked into the cake, but
in our day a wee little china image is usually substituted
for the bean. When ready the cake is cut
into slices and the youngest child at the table directs
how these slices shall be distributed to the others.
There is great excitement as slice after slice is handed
out and eaten.</p>

<p>At last some one’s teeth come in contact with the
image and he spits it out. “He,” I say, on the supposition
that it is a boy. If it is, indeed, a boy, he
is called King of the Bean (le Roi Favette), and
chooses a queen from among the girls. If it be a girl
she becomes queen and chooses a boy as her consort.</p>

<p>King and queen are now closely watched by their
companions. When either of them drinks the whole
party has to cry out “The king drinks” or “the queen
drinks,” as the case may be. Any one who fails to
join in the cry has to pay a forfeit.</p>

<p>In England the custom varies in different localities
as it has varied at different dates.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>What it was in London during the middle of the
nineteenth century is best described by Hone in his
“Table Book:”</p>

<p>“First buy your cake,” says this author. “Next,
look at your invitation list, and count the number of
ladies you expect, and afterwards the number of gentlemen.</p>

<p>“Then you write down on slips of paper the names
of as many famous characters in history, male and
female, as will cover the list of guests. Add to each
slip some pleasant bit of verse.</p>

<p>“Fold them up exactly of the same size, and number
each on the back; taking care to make the king
No. 1 and the queen No. 2. Cause tea and coffee to
be handed to your visitors as they drop in. When
all are assembled and tea is over, put as many ladies’
characters in a reticule as there are ladies present;
next put the gentlemen’s characters in a hat. Then
call on a gentleman to carry the reticule to the ladies
as they sit; from which each lady is to draw one ticket
and to preserve it unopened. Select a lady to bear
the hat to the gentlemen, for the same purpose.
There will be one ticket left in the reticule, and another
in the hat,—which the lady and gentleman who carried
each is to interchange, as having fallen to each.
Next arrange your visitors, according to their numbers;—the
king No. 1, the queen No. 2 and so on.
The king is then to recite the verse on his ticket; then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
the queen a verse on hers; and so the characters are
to proceed in numerical order.</p>

<p>“This done, let the cake and refreshments go round;
and hey! for merriment!”</p>

<p>In earlier days, however, we know that the cake
played a more important part in the festivities than
Hone allows to it. In fact the English here closely
followed the French fashion which I have already
described, although in England the King’s bean was
supplemented by a pea for the Queen. This much
we may learn from a poem by Robert Herrick, who
lived in the seventeenth century:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="indent2">Now, now, the mirth comes</div>
<div class="indent2">With the cake full of plums,</div>
<div class="verse">Where bean is the king of the sport here;</div>
<div class="indent2">Beside we must know,</div>
<div class="indent2">The pea also</div>
<div class="verse">Must revel as queen in the court here.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indent2">Begin then to choose</div>
<div class="indent2">This night as ye use,</div>
<div class="verse">Who shall for the present delight here;</div>
<div class="indent2">Be a king by the lot,</div>
<div class="indent2">And who shall not</div>
<div class="verse">Be Twelfth-day Queen for the night here.</div>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>ST. NICHOLAS IN ENGLAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Nicholas</span> is practically forgotten to-day in
Protestant England. But in the merrie England of
olden times, before the Catholic religion had given
way to Protestantism, he was one of the most popular
saints in the calendar.</p>

<p>This is shown not only by the number of churches
dedicated in his honor, but also by the number of boys
who received his name in baptism. Nicholases were
once as common among the Englishmen of the past
as Maries were among English women. A curious
fact may be brought up in evidence. In English catechisms,
whose forms date from a very early time, the
question is put to the pupil:</p>

<p>“What is your name?”</p>

<p>And the answer is printed thus: “N. or M.” Of
course the pupil is expected to put his or her name in
place of these initials. Now it is probable that N
stands for Nicholas and M for Mary, and the choice of
these initials was made not only because Nicholas was
the patron of boys and Mary of girls, but because these
were the commonest names in Old England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>The feast of St. Nicholas used to be celebrated by
a ceremony known as the election of a Boy-bishop.
This custom existed to some extent on the continent
of Europe, but it nowhere flourished so vigorously
as in England. It has been traced as far back as
the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>To the choir boys and altar boys of English
churches it was a particularly exciting time.</p>

<p>On St. Nicholas’ eve all the boys who sang in the
choir or served at the altar met at their parish church,
or in the great cathedral, if they belonged to a bishop’s
see, and elected one from among their number, who
took the title of “the Boy-bishop.” This title with
its dignities he retained until December 28th, Holy
Innocents’ Day, so called because it is the anniversary
of the slaughter of the children in Palestine by order
of the wicked King Herod.</p>

<p>The Boy-bishop was dressed in the robes of a real
bishop. On his head was placed a mitre, in his right
hand a crozier. Another boy was elected dean, while
the rest were styled canons, all being dressed in the
robes of their office.</p>

<p>During the three weeks from December 5 to December
28, the Boy-bishop could perform all the duties
of a real bishop, except that of saying mass. If
a priest died during the period when he held office
he could appoint another to take his place in the
church left vacant. If he himself died before Holy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
Innocents’ Day he was given a bishop’s grand funeral
in the cathedral.</p>

<p>“There is a little tomb of this kind,” says Miss
Abbie Farwell Brown, “not half the size of a full-grown
one, in a great cathedral that I know. It is
of white marble, grandly carved and decorated, and
though it is worn and nicked by eight hundred years
of change, one can plainly see that it is a child’s face
among the long curls beneath the bishop’s mitre. No
one knows his name, nor aught about him, save that
he must be one of the Boy-bishops who died at Christmas
time, or he would not be buried in the great
cathedral tomb.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless Miss Brown has in mind the cathedral
of Salisbury, England. In the nave of that great
minster there is just such a tomb, with just such a
likeness carved upon it. The boy’s foot rests on the
figure of a monster with a lion’s head and a dragon’s
tail, in allusion to the words of the psalmist “Thou
shalt tread on the lion and the dragon.”</p>

<p>But to continue. On December 6th the newly
elected Boy-bishop with his dean and canons held a
grand service in the church to which they were attached,
the prayers being chanted in the boy’s sweet
childish voice. A great crowd always thronged the
church to gaze on so rare a sight, and the offerings
that they made were all for the Boy-bishop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>After the services were over the bishop and his boy-assistants
would form themselves into a procession
and parade through the streets of the town or the
lanes of the countryside, asking some small money
tributes from all they met and at every door where
they knocked. This was known as the Bishop’s Subsidy
and though no one was likely to give a great
deal, yet as the procession was continued every day
during the three weeks, the amount collected sometimes
rolled up into quite a pretty sum.</p>

<p>Faster and more furious grew the fun as the time
of the bishop’s rule neared its close. On the afternoon
of December 27th little Nicholas and his companions
sang vespers, while the real priests of the
church acted as altar boys and choristers. Then the
Boy-bishop gave a solemn benediction to all present.
Making the sign of the cross over the kneeling
throngs, he dismissed them with the words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Crucis signo vos consigno; vestra sit tuitio,</div>
<div class="verse">Quos nos emit et redemit suae carnis pretio.</div>
</div></div>

<p>These latin words being translated into English mean:</p>

<p>“I bestow upon you the sign of the cross, yours
be it to learn what is sent for our redemption through
the price of his flesh.”</p>

<p>Next day (the actual feast of the Holy Innocents),
the Boy-bishop preached a sermon which usually was
written for him by some famous prelate. On his dismissal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
of the congregation at the close of the sermon,
the festival of the Boy-bishop was at an end.</p>

<p>When Henry VIII became a Protestant and
brought over a great many of his subjects to the
new faith one of his first acts was to abolish the Boy-bishop
and his festival. Henry’s daughter, Queen
Mary, restored both for the few years of her own
reign, but Queen Elizabeth, her sister and successor,
put an end to the mummery forever.</p>

<p>We catch our last glimpse of the Boy-bishop in
the pages of a historian called William Strype, who
informs us that on the fifth day of December, 1556,
(Queen Mary being then still alive) “a boy habited
like a bishop in pontificalibus, went abroad in most
parts of London, singing after the old fashion, and
was received by many ignorant but well disposed people
into their houses, and had as much good cheer as
was ever wont to be had before, at least in many places.”</p>

<p>Old customs die hard. We have come across many
instances of the truth of this saying in the course
of our study of the Christmas festivals. Just as Christianity
had to retain and remodel many old heathen
customs, so Protestantism (often without meaning
it) retained and remodeled many an old Catholic custom.
Just as Silenus, and Saturn, survived in a
measure as Santa Claus, so the Boy-bishop, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
measure, survived as the hero of a ceremony which
flourished at the school of Eton until nearly the middle
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>This was known as Eton Montem. It was celebrated
not in December but in June, though tradition
tells us that the original date was St. Nicholas Day
and that the ceremony was instituted in the year
1440, the very year when Eton was founded.</p>

<p>Later it took place every third year on the Tuesday
after Whitsunday or Pentecost, which usually falls
in June. On that day a procession of all the scholars
went from the school buildings to a hill known as
Salt Hill that rises just outside of the grounds. At
their head marched the captain and his chaplain, the
one being the head boy of the highest class in school,
the other the head boy of the second class. The
chaplain was dressed in a suit of priestly black with
a bushy wig upon his head.</p>

<p>Two boys called “salt bearers” with “scouts”
dressed like old-time footmen ran beside the procession
begging from all passersby and they scattered
through the roads to beg at the doors of houses for
miles around.</p>

<p>The money thus collected was put into a great bag,
already sprinkled with a small quantity of salt and
at the end of the day this bag was handed over to
the captain. It was used to pay his expenses when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
he left Eton for some one of the great universities.
Not infrequently it mounted up to hundreds of dollars
and sometimes even to a thousand or more.</p>

<p>Up to the middle of the eighteenth century it
was customary for the chaplain to read prayers on
Salt Hill. He was assisted by a clerk whom he
kicked down hill at their conclusion. The irreverence
of this part of the ceremony shocked Queen Caroline
and at her request it was ever afterwards omitted.
In 1847 the entire ceremony was abolished by act
of Parliament, the last celebration having taken place
on June 28th, 1844.</p>

<p>And thus the last vestige of Saint Nicholas passed
out of the ceremonial life of England.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>FATHER CHRISTMAS AND HIS FAMILY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> English, as I have said, have no Saint Nicholas,
no Santa Klaus, no Chris-kinkle to act as a distributor
of gifts on Christmas eve. They hail as the
patron of the season a vague allegorical being, usually
called Father Christmas, though he has, sometimes,
been known also as Old Christmas, Captain Christmas,
and by other titles.</p>

<p>He appears only in picture, in poetry, and in dramatic
pieces specially got up for the holidays. In the
latter he has played an important part from a very
early period. The most famous of such pieces was a
“masque” written by Ben Jonson, Shakespeare’s
friend and rival, and produced at the court of King
James I in the year 1616. That, by the way, is the
very year of Shakespeare’s death.</p>

<p>Christmas festivities at that time were frowned
down upon by many of the more zealous Protestants—just
then beginning to earn the name of “Puritans”—who
fancied that these mummeries and rejoicings
smacked too strongly of “Papist” or Roman Catholic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
tendencies. Indeed many fanatics had striven
to abolish Christmas altogether, and had partly succeeded
in doing so, at least among the people who
believed as they did. But James I, though a foolish
person in some respects, was a learned man and a
great lover of the traditions of the past.</p>

<p>It is in allusion to the Puritan attempt to suppress
him altogether that Ben Jonson’s Father Christmas
utters these words as he makes his entrance upon
the stage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Why, gentlemen, do you know what you do? Ha! would
you have kept me out? <span class="smcap">Christmas!</span>—Old Christmas—Christmas
of London, and Captain Christmas! Pray you let
me be brought before my Lord Chamberlain; I’ll not be
answered else. ‘<i>’Tis merry in hall, when beards wag all.</i>’
I have seen the time you have wished for me, for a merry
Christmas, and now you have me, they would not let me in:
<i>I must come another time!</i> A good jest—as if I could come
more than once a year. Why, I am no dangerous person,
and so I told my friends of the guard. I am old Gregory
Christmas, still, and, though I come out of the Pope’s Head-alley,
as good a Protestant as any in my parish.”</p>
</div>

<p>He must have been a quaint looking figure, this
same Father Christmas, for we are told that his costume
consisted of</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“round hose, long stockings, close doublet, high-crowned
hat, with a brooch, long, thin beard, truncheon, little ruffs,
white shoes, with his scarfs and garters tied cross, and his
drum beaten before him,”</p>
</div>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>And now, to the sound of the drum, in troop all
his merry family—sons and daughters and nephews
and nieces. Among them are the Lord of Misrule,
who in old days directed the Christmas revels; Roast
Beef, “that English Champion bold,” who has saved
many a sturdy Englishman from starvation; Plum
Pudding, a blackamoor, with rich round face and
rosemary cockade; and Minced Pie, and Baby Cake,
and Mumming and Wassail and Offering and Carol,
and New Year’s Gift, and others too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p>Many members of this robust family will be recognized
as contributors to the Christmas cheer of
to-day. Others have disappeared forever.</p>

<p>The Lord of Misrule, for example, the “Grand
Captain of Mischief,” as the Puritans called him, no
longer summons around him all the madcap youths
of town or village for a brief period of lawless revelry.</p>

<p>In Scotland this personage was known as the Abbot
of Unreason, a name which clearly shows that he
was a direct descendant from the chief performer in
the mediæval Feast of Fools, and as such was a
great-great-etc.-grandson of Silenus, the merrymaker
in the Greek Bacchanalia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>King James I of England was succeeded by his
son Charles I. During the reign of the latter unhappy
monarch, the Puritan party in England gathered
so much strength that, under the lead of Oliver
Cromwell, they hurled Charles from his throne and
cut off his head, sending his entire family into exile
for a period of a dozen years. Father Christmas
shared the exile of his royal patrons, or if he dared
show his face in England at all, it was only here and
there in remote country places or behind locked doors
in the obscurer parts of the great cities. Meanwhile
his absence was greatly deplored by that part of the
English people who had remained loyal to the crown.
One of these put forward a curious little book entitled
“An Hue and Cry after Christmas.” The following
paragraph shows the spirit in which the book
was written:</p>

<p>“Any man or woman, that can give any knowledge,
or tell any tidings of an old, old, very old grey-bearded
gentleman, called Christmas, who was wont
to be a very familiar guest and visit all sorts of people,
both poor and rich, and used to appear in glittering
gold, silk and silver, in the court, and in all
shapes in the theatre in White Hall, and had ringing,
feasts and jollity in all places, both in the city
and the country, for his coming—whoever can tell
what is become of him, or where he may be found, let
him bring him back again into England.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171-172]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>Well, Father Christmas did come back to England
in the train of Charles I’s son, Charles II who
shortly after Cromwell’s death was restored to the
English throne by the wish of the majority of the
English people.</p>

<p>When he resumed the rule that had been wrested
by the Puritans from his father the old celebrations
of Christmas were to some extent revived in the
royal and other mansions and at the theatres.</p>

<p>“To some extent”—that is too often a sad phrase!</p>

<p>It means, in this case, that pretty much all the
life and spirit of the old ceremonies had departed
so that no revival could restore them to their former
vitality.</p>

<p>The changes wrought by the troublous times
through which England had passed were fatal to
the old-time splendors of the Christmas season. In
the country many of the great old estates had passed
into new hands and the old ties between the lord of
the manor and his tenants had been forever sundered.
The rafters of the old baronial halls no longer rang
with the merriment which had graced the meeting
of master and servants on a holiday basis of equality.
Friends and relatives who from childhood had gathered
together around the Yule log were now scattered
or had been slain by the chances of war. Members
of old country families deprived by Cromwell of their
estates and driven into exile, now flocked to London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
to become hangers-on at the court of a “Merry Monarch”
whose mirth was often bought at the expense
of his subject’s years.</p>

<p>The Merry Monarch, himself (that was the name
given to Charles II), was a prodigal and a spendthrift,
who found all sorts of new ways in which to
squander the money raised by taxes from his subjects.
He had little left, therefore, to imitate the splendid
pageants that distinguished the courts of Queen
Elizabeth and James I at the ancient holiday seasons.</p>

<p>A famous song called “The Old and Young
Courtier” was written shortly after Charles II had
regained his throne. It sadly contrasts the good old
times and the good old people with the bad new times
and the bad new people of the Restoration.</p>

<p>The old courtier is lovingly described as “a worshipful
old gentleman who had a great estate,” with
a lovely old wife by his side, and a great band of
servants around them. Then followed this verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">With a good old fashion when Christmas was come,</div>
<div class="verse">To call in all his old neighbors with bagpipe and drum,</div>
<div class="verse">With good cheer enough to furnish every room,</div>
<div class="verse">And old liquor able to make a cat speak, and man dumb;</div>
<div class="indent4">Like an old courtier of the queen’s</div>
<div class="indent4">And the queen’s old courtier.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>A contrast is drawn between this old courtier of the
queen’s and the young courtier of the king’s, with all
his new-fangled notions, and especially</p>

<div class="indent4">And the king’s young courtier.</div>
</div></div>

<p>From time to time, even in periods nearer to our
own, complaints have been raised in England that
the spirit of the old-time Christmas merriment has
departed forever, and that good old Father Christmas
is once more an exile from his own.</p>

<p>A cartoon by Linley M. Sambourne published in
the <i>London Punch</i> for December 24, 1881, shows the
Old-Fashioned Christmas holding a lively conversation
with the New.</p>

<p>This prose bit is printed beneath the picture:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>Christmas</i> (<i>New Style</i>). “<span class="smcap">We are the Modern Christmas Cards—we
are! we are! we are!</span>”</p>

<p><i>Christmas</i> (<i>Old Style</i>). “<span class="smcap">You represent Christmas!
Pooh! What do you mean by coming out like that at
this time of Year?</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Then follows this poem, which still further explains
the meaning of the picture:</p>

<p>After all, may it not be safe for us to decide that

the heart of Old Father Christmas still beats warm
under the new garb wherein changing tastes have
clothed him? Surely, if we have dropped some of
the revellings of the past, we have dropped also the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
abuses which gradually made distasteful the horse
play that attended those revelries.</p>

<p>On the whole the “new-fangled Christmas” has
many points that show an improvement over the old-fashioned
Christmas while in all essentials the two
remain one and the same.</p>

<p>Some humble members of Father Christmas’ family
still surviving to a small extent in London are the
“waits” or wandering musicians who play dismal
tunes under the windows of the well-to-do in the hopes
of obtaining a few pennies.</p>

<p>These are direct descendants from the “jongleurs”
or minstrels who in the Middle Ages celebrated the
birth of Christ on Christmas night with song and
dance.</p>

<small>PANTOMIME IN THE PAST AND PRESENT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> people still living (but they must be very
aged people by now) may be able to remember the
pantomime which was one of the great features of the
Christmas holidays in early nineteenth century
England, and may be looked upon as the legitimate
successor of the ancient “masque.” The word pantomime
comes from two Greek words meaning “all
mimicry.” It is a play in which the actors say never
a word but perform their parts in dumb show, that
is, by signs and gestures. Being almost unknown in
America this word of explanation may be necessary.</p>

<p>England borrowed the pantomime from Italy,
where it has survived from the masked frolics
of the Roman Saturnalia. Pantaloon, Harlequin
and the Fairy Columbine were the principal actors in
all the Italian pantomimes and all of them wore
masks.</p>

<p>A famous player named Rich, who was known on
the stage as Lun, was the first to introduce pantomime
into England. In the year 1717 he produced
a play of this sort called Harlequin Executed, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
which he himself performed the part of Harlequin.
It is said that he “could describe to the audience by
his signs and gestures as intelligibly as others could
express by words.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>David Garrick, perhaps the greatest of all English
actors, was a younger contemporary of Rich and after
his friend’s death he celebrated the silent but powerful
language of Rich in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When Lun appeared, with matchless grace and ishm,</div>
<div class="verse">He gave the power of speech to every limb,</div>
<div class="verse">Though masked and mute, conveyed his quick intent,</div>
<div class="verse">And told in frolic gestures all he meant;</div>
<div class="verse">But now the motley coat and sword of wood</div>
<div class="verse">Require a tongue to make them understood.</div>
</div></div>

<p>By the last lines Garrick evidently means to say
that spoken words had in his time been introduced into
the so-called pantomime, because no actor remained
who was capable of conveying his meaning by nod
or wink or gesture in the old-time manner.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the nineteenth century, however,
all and more of the original glories of pantomime
were brought back to the English stage by
Joseph Grimaldi, an Italian by birth, but an Englishman
by adoption. He was the greatest clown known
to the history of English drama.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187-188]</span></p>

<p class="caption">Jongleurs announcing the birth of our Lord.<br>

<small>From a painting by A. F. Gorguet.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>After his retirement, in 1828, pantomime still
flourished for a number of years as the chief dramatic
feature of the Christmas season.</p>

<p>St. Stephen’s Day (December 26, the day after
Christmas) was the day specially set aside for the
production of a pantomime, but in due time those performances
were extended all over the Christmas season.
They were the particular delight of the young
folk, though older folk also liked to attend them
and live their youth over again in the joy reflected
from the faces of the boys and girls in the audience.</p>

<p>Leigh Hunt, a charming English writer who never
lost his boy-heart tells us how much pleasure he found
in watching the children at a pantomime.</p>

<p>“I am more delighted,” he says, “in watching the
vivacious workings of their ingenuous countenances
at these Christmas shows than at the sights themselves....
Stretching half over the boxes at
the theatre, adorned by maternal love, see their enraptured
faces, now turned to the galleries, wondering
at their height and at the number of regular-placed
heads contained in them; now directed towards
the green cloud which is so lingeringly kept between
them and their promised bliss. The half-peeled
orange laid aside when the play begins; their anxiety
for that which they understand; their honest laughter
which runs through the house like a merry peal of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
sweet bells; the fear of the little girl lest they should
discover the person hid behind the screen; the exultation
of the boy when the hero conquers. But, oh,
the rapture when the pantomime commences! Ready
to leap out of the box, they joy in the mischief of
the clown, laugh at the thwacks he gets for his meddling,
and feel no small portion of contempt for his
ignorance in not knowing that hot water will scald
and gunpowder explode; while, with head aside to
give fresh energy to the strokes, they ring their little
palms against each other in testimony of exuberant
delight.”</p>

<p>Pantomime in the England of to-day has dwindled
into a mere side show for spectacular ballets,
which are now all the fashion. Clown and Columbine
are indeed, occasionally introduced into these ballets
but the clown is no longer a leading character
and Columbine and her companions are selected more
for their skill in dancing than in the art of gesture.</p>

<p>Very rarely, indeed, is a comic mask introduced
into a Christmas piece nowadays. Formerly, Harlequin
and Columbine wore little black masks that
just covered the upper part of the face, while the
rest of the jolly crew of elves, ogres and buffoons
were disguised in huge headpieces arranged over their
shoulders.</p>

<p>And here comes in the point of the picture by Mr.
Potter which I have reproduced from the Christmas
number of an English weekly called <i>The Sporting
Times</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191-192]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>The young woman of this picture is a “high-kicker”
who evidently has made a hit with the audience
at a modern Christmas ballet. When she gets behind
the scenes among “properties” left over from
the ancient days, she gives a frisky vent to her feelings
by flashing her heels in the faces of the grinning
old masks.</p>

<p>In short, she represents pantomime in its most modern
development, the ballet, as contrasted with the
grotesque humors of the past.</p>

<p>You may find food for both humor and pathos,
in the idea which Mr. Potter has worked out in this
pretty and ingenious manner.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>SAINT NICHOLAS IN EUROPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no country in Europe where Saint Nicholas
is more honored than in Holland. Even before
his festival arrives—during all the first five days of
December—the shops in town and city put on their
most festive array. All the people in shop and street
assume a brisk and bustling air. Dutch men and
Dutch women, usually silent and stolid, hail one another
with noisy greetings as they meet. Everybody,
in short, has his best foot foremost.</p>

<p>Amsterdam, one of many cities which claim Saint
Nicholas as their patron saint, is especially wideawake.
During the first week of December the confectioners’
shops are ablaze with all sorts of splendors in cake
and candy. Sugar rabbits, sugar cats and sugar
mice disport themselves amid scenery of sugar and
chocolate and wood shavings. The shavings (painted
a vivid green), supply the foliage for chocolate trees
and candied fruits. In all shapes and sizes are figures
of men and women made out of crisp brown
gingerbread, called Saint Nicholas cake, which is
specially prepared for the holiday. These figures are
sometimes known as “sweethearts” and it is a merry
jest to send a girl figure to a boy and a boy figure to
a girl. Nay the elders themselves are not forgotten
if they are unmarried. It is good fun, we are told,
to have a servant burst into a roomful of people and
say to the lady of the house:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195-196]</span></p>
<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_195">

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>“If you please ma’am, here is Miss Annie’s sweetheart,”
and hand over to mamma a gingerbread man
for her little girl.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Other jokes of the same kind are played with so-called
“hearts,” large and luscious pieces of march-pane
moulded into the familiar shape supposed to
resemble the organ that is supposed to be the seat of
human affection. These are exchanged among the
young people much as valentines, with us, are exchanged
on February 14th.</p>

<p>“Of course,” says the authority I have already
quoted, a lady of Holland birth who speaks of what
she herself has seen and experienced, “most girls like
having such an innocent heart sent to them, and it
is funny to see the mysterious look with which one
tells another:</p>

<p>“‘I had a large heart sent to me last night. I cannot
possibly think who sent it.’”</p>

<p>Here and there in the streets you will see groups
of boys and girls clustered around a linen-draper’s
shop. For it is the linen drapers who especially love<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
to display in their windows a life-like image of Saint
Nicholas, ruddy-faced, white-bearded, crowned with
his mitre and clad in his bright red robe lined with
soft white fur, bearing a crozier in his hand, and
mounted on a fiery white horse. Behind him stands
his negro servant Jan, or John.</p>

<p>On December 5th, the eve of the saint’s feast, he
is said to ride over the roofs of the houses, dropping
candies into the wide chimneys. And indeed, in
houses where children believe this, their faith is rewarded
by the fact that candies and other goodies
do stream down into the great open hearths and are
gathered in by eager little people who have been
singing the saint’s praises all through the evening.</p>

<p>In many households, moreover, the saint actually
presents himself to the eyes of his worshippers
and admirers. A knock is heard at the door; it is
opened, and amid the breathless silence of the children,
Santa Klaus, in flesh and blood, and in all the
glory of scarlet robe and bejewelled mitre, steps into
the room. He is closely followed by his servant Jan,
who bears a basket containing all sorts of presents
for the good children, and all sorts of unpleasant reminders
for the bad ones.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>Before these things are distributed, Santa Klaus
calls up the children one by one. He praises the
good ones for all the kind deeds they have done during
the past year, while gently reproving any faults
which may have mingled with their virtues. To the
bad ones he is stern but just. He reminds them of
their misdeeds, and tells them that he cannot give
them any presents until they improve. If they have
been very, very bad, he hands a birch-rod over to their
parents with the advice that it should be used upon
their little backs in the task of reformation.</p>

<p>Great is the wonder that Santa Klaus should know
so much about the children in a whole neighborhood.
He goes, or is supposed to go, from house to house
in the course of the day, and everywhere he praises
the virtues or condemns the faults of the boys and
girls arrayed to meet him. Sometimes it is found,
by comparing notes, that he was in two or more houses
at the same time.</p>

<p>Of course, you who have had your eyes opened,
guess that the part of Santa Klaus is taken by some
older member of each family, who confines his visits
to his own circle of relatives. Except in very small
villages, there are many Santa Klauses, therefore,
going the rounds on Saint Nicholas’s day, each well
acquainted in the houses he visits.</p>

<p>In Austria, also, and in many parts of Southern
Germany, St. Nicholas Eve is made memorable in
every nursery by a visit from the saint. A well
grown boy with a quick and clever mind and some
knowledge of church doctrine, is chosen to play the
part of Santa Klaus. He is masked in long white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
vestments. A silk scarf is wound around his neck,
a mitre crowns his head, a crozier is put in his hand.
He is attended by two angels and a whole troop of
devils.</p>

<p>The angels are dressed much like the choir boys
you have seen in Catholic and Episcopalian churches,
save that they also wear silken scarfs around their
necks. Each carries a basket.</p>

<p>The devils blacken their faces, put horns upon their
heads and decorate their faces with pig’s snouts or
any other grotesque device that may suggest itself
to their fancy. All are girt with chains, which they
shake or rattle furiously.</p>

<p>Boy-like, it is thought much better fun to play devil
than angel, and any boy who can lay his hands upon
a suitable costume is at liberty to join the infernal
train.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of December 5th the Boy-bishop
and his attendants begin their round of visits.
It is the season for young folks’ parties, and all the
children of the village who are not masquerading as
bishop or angel or imp have gathered together in a
few of the principal houses. At each Saint Nicholas
calls in its due turn.</p>

<p>He enters with the two angels, leaving the demons
outside to indulge in any pranks they will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203-204]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>A great hush falls upon the assembled children as
the Saint advances into the room. One by one he
calls them up to examine them. Simple questions
suited to their various ages are put to them by the
bishop, after which each has to repeat a hymn or a
prayer. All this part of the evening’s business is
carried on with the greatest seriousness and decorum
on the part of children and grown-ups alike.</p>

<p>If the child passes a satisfactory examination the
angels present it with nuts and apples—if not it
has to stand aside. When the last of the examinations
is over, the devils are admitted into the room.</p>

<p>They are not allowed to come near the good children,
but they may tease and frighten the naughty
little boys and girls as much as they choose. They
delight in strange dances, and in all sorts of odd
antics, such as smearing the girls’ faces with lamp-black,
or putting coal dust and ashes down the backs
of the boys.</p>

<p>When Saint Nicholas has left, the children return
to their own homes. Before going to bed they hang
up their stockings by the chimney or, more likely,
place their little boots and shoes close to the hearth,
expecting to find them filled with gifts in the morning.</p>

<p>Boots and shoes indeed, came before stockings almost
everywhere, the advantages of clean stockings
as receivers for candies and other eatables being a
comparatively new discovery. In Belgium to this
day the children give their shoes an extra fine polish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
on Christmas Eve, fill them with hay, oats, carrots,
for Santa Klaus’s white horse, and put them on the
table, or set them in the fireplace. The room is then
carefully closed and the door is locked.</p>

<p>In the morning a strange thing is found to have
happened! The furniture is all turned topsy-turvy,
the fodder has been removed from the shoes and in
its place the good little children find all sorts of nice
things and the bad ones only rods of birch and bits of
coal.</p>

<p>Boots and shoes are also in use in many parts of
France. But here, as a general rule, it is the good
little Jesus (le bon petit Jesus) who comes down the
chimney to fill all this footgear with sweetmeats.
Formerly this custom extended to Paris. A French
journalist named Charton thus describes the sights
that met his eye on Christmas eve in Paris in the middle
of the nineteenth century:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207-208]</span></p>

<small>Drawing by C. J. Taylor.</small></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>“Lo! what a strange thing! Before all the mantelpieces
of Paris are ranged, with a wonderful symmetry,
charming little shoes, pretty little <i>bottines</i>,
miniature slippers, and, as the extremities of the <i>faubourgs</i>,
poor little sabots! It will be asked, what all
those tiny little boots and shoes are doing there?
There are enough of them to cover the feet of all the
inhabitants of the vast kingdom of Lilliput. What
are they doing there? They are waiting for a beautiful
little luminous hand to descend from heaven to
fill them with preserved fruits and bonbons! In the
olden time the presents intended for children were
fastened to the two ends of the Yule Log. Later an
attempt was made to introduce into France the Christmas tree,
which, in a large portion of Europe, has
superseded the Yule Log. But it is most usual to
keep to the simple custom of filling the little shoes
with bonbons, which more than one mother of the laboring
classes has had the foresight to reserve for
that purpose. We will not venture to say that, whilst
the good mother or the elder sister is stealthily approaching
the hearth and stooping down, one of the
little sleepers, kept awake with expectation, does not
open his eyelids slily, and say to himself: ‘Ah! I was
sure it was not the little Jesus!’ But the prudent
child will take care not to confess that he has discovered
the mystery; he has too much interest in being
cheated next Christmas day; and in a few hours the
room will ring with his cries of false surprise but real
gratification.”</p>

<p>Only candies and sweetmeats, you will see, were
brought down through the chimney by the Christ-child
on Christmas eve. The favorite time for gift-making
from parent to child, from child to parent,
from friend to friend, was on New Year’s Day.
Hence that holiday is known as “Le Jour des Étrennes”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
(the day of presents), “étrennes” being a corruption
of the Latin word “strenae,” the gifts exchanged
during the Saturnalia, about which I have written in
the fourth chapter of this book.</p>

<p>Though Saint Nicholas is honored as the patron
of children in nearly all the Catholic countries of
continental Europe, he is rarely associated in any
way with Christmas. That day is there held sacred
to the Christ-child alone. In a very few localities
Saint Nicholas may appear on his own day to find
out what good little boys and girls would like to have
on Christmas, or, sometimes, at New Year’s, but it is
generally the little Jesus who is the actual gift bringer.</p>

<p>In the Catholic portions of Austria and Germany
all of the windows are lit up on the night of December
24 so as to enable Him to pick His way from house to
house. Here you may again recognize a lingering
memory of the Pagan and Jewish festivals wherein
lighted torches, or lamps, or candles form a chief feature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>And, indeed, one may point out right here that the
Christ-child supplies another link with the old pagan
Silenus. The latter, as I have told you, was, among
other things, the guardian and tutor of the infant
Bacchus. Whenever picture or statue represented
him in this capacity all his evil traits were dropped.
He became a very different being from the graceless
reveller of the Bacchanalian feasts. He was now
painted or carved as an old man, grave and sober,
clean-cut in limbs and features, holding little Bacchus
in his arms or on his shoulders. Possibly this figure
may have suggested the mediæval legend of Saint
Christopher, who, it is fabled, bore the Christ-child
on his shoulders across a river in Germany.</p>

<p>In Italy almost every church has an altar dedicated
to the Christ-child and decorated with a wooden
or waxen effigy known as “Il Bambino,” or “the
babe.” On Christmas day this Bambino is specially
honored by being dressed up in his finest clothes and
placed in a mimic cradle, called a presepio. All good
Catholics flock to do the image honor during the
twelve days from Christmas to Epiphany.</p>

<p>The most famous Bambino in Italy is that in the
Franciscan church of Ara Cœli at Rome, which is believed
to heal the sick and perform other miracles.
On Christmas day a curious ceremony is performed in
his honor which makes our thoughts travel back to
the Boy-bishop of old England and elsewhere. Opposite
the presepio in which the little waxen figure
reposes is built a palco, or platform, and on this platform
a number of baby orators follow one another
with little speeches, written by their elders, that dwell
upon the birth of our Lord and the incidents of His
childhood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>SAINT NICHOLAS IN AMERICA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> as the Christmas tree was brought over to this
country by early German immigrants so Saint Nicholas,
or Santa Klaus, came here in the train of the
Dutch settlers of New York. He established himself
first in the little island of Manhattan and then
gradually spread all over the country, being greatly
assisted by the fact that he was no stranger to the
German settlers everywhere. But his Dutch origin
is shown by the very name Santa Klaus, which is common
alike to Holland and America, though it is elsewhere
unknown.</p>

<p>At first he was honored on his own day with the
same observances that marked the festival in the Fatherland.</p>

<p>Before the beginning of the nineteenth century,
however, St. Nicholas’s day had been all but forgotten
in New Amsterdam (the Dutch name for New York)
and we find that New Year’s eve was the occasion
when he made his rounds as a gift bearer to the children.
Later he transferred his activities to Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215-216]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>I reproduce from an old New York magazine,
dated January, 1844, a print which shows Santa
Klaus on the point of remounting a chimney after
filling the stockings of the children of the household.
The text expressly says that the time is New Year’s
eve.</p>

<p>To go further back, we know that even in the
eighteenth century, when New York was still to a
great extent Dutch in blood and in feeling, the little
children of the Knickerbockers would gather expectant
around the great hearth in the parlor on the eve
of New Year and not on the eve of Saint Nicholas’s
feast. It was to Saint Nicholas, however, that they
addressed the childish hymns and songs which their
forefathers had brought over from Holland.</p>

<p>Here are two specimen verses:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Santa Klaus, good holy man!</div>
<div class="verse">Go your way from Amsterdam;</div>
<div class="verse">From Amsterdam to Spain,</div>
<div class="verse">From Spain to Orange,</div>
<div class="verse">And bring us little children toys.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Saint Nicholas, my dear good friend,</div>
<div class="verse">To praise you ever is my end.</div>
<div class="verse">If you will presents to me give</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll serve you till I cease to live.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>It was about the middle of the nineteenth century
that the funny men of America took the Saint under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
their special patronage. In Holland he had been
austere and dignified, as became a bishop and a saint.
In America he developed into the fat, jolly, pot-bellied
old roysterer whom we all know and love and who
reminds us at so many points of the fun loving
Silenus of Pagan times.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly it was the American Clement C.
Moore who immortalized the figure and decided the
model which all succeeding poets and artists have ever
followed. This is how Santa Klaus is described in
Mr. Moore’s very popular poem entitled “A Visit
from Santa Klaus”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,</div>
<div class="verse">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;</div>
<div class="verse">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,</div>
<div class="verse">And he looked like a pedlar just opening his pack,</div>
<div class="verse">His eyes how they twinkled! his dimples how merry!</div>
<div class="verse">His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.</div>
<div class="verse">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,</div>
<div class="verse">And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.</div>
<div class="verse">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,</div>
<div class="verse">And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath,</div>
<div class="verse">He had a broad face and a little round belly</div>
<div class="verse">That shook, when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly,</div>
<div class="verse">He was chubby and plump—a right jolly old elf—</div>
<div class="verse">And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Year by year the funny men of the pencil and the
pen do their best to add to his eccentricities yet always
they retain a measure of respect for the dear old gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>One comic artist sends him to Wall Street among
the brokers and the bankers, yet he preserves his dignity
even among those shrewd and clever men, and
is ready to teach them more than they can hope to
teach him.</p>

<p>Other artists make him turn to account the latest
inventions of our inventors and scientists. Even if
one picture does show him coming to grief on an
automobile, another catches him in the very act of
utilizing a flying machine.</p>

<p>Again we are shown another side of the matter.
We are brought face to face with the unbelief of the
child who is ripening into boyhood or girlhood.</p>

<p>At six years old or sometimes later doubts begin
to visit the youthful mind. These doubts are carried
very far by the little girl—a juvenile Saint Thomas
in pantalettes—who in Mr. J. R. Shaver’s picture,
meets Santa Klaus face to face, yet tells him to
his face that she doesn’t believe in him.</p>

<p>At this period in their lives young folks of both
sexes will sympathize with the spirit of inquiry that
summons Saint Nicholas, as in Mr. O’Malley’s cartoon,
to answer before a judge and jury of their own
age the question as to whether he has any real existence.</p>

<p>And now turn to the last picture of all, that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
Mr. Henry Hutt has kindly lent me for reproduction
in this little book, and if you insist on an answer which
will rob you of the bliss of ignorance, perhaps you
will find it there!</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
